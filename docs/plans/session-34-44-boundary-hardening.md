# Session 34-44 Boundary Hardening Playbook

Scope:
- Consolidate lifetime/ownership transitions into one audited boundary API.
- Improve old internals (code quality + business logic), not just wrap them.
- Keep behavior stable while reducing bug surface.

Execution policy:
- Do not advance sessions unless all gates pass.
- Keep commits small and domain-local.
- Prefer behavior-preserving refactors before semantic changes.

## Current Status (2026-03-04)

- Sessions 34-44 goals: completed in sequence (see `memory/CHANGELOG.md` and commit history).
- Continued hardening/decomposition after Session 44: Sessions 45-68 completed.
- Validation discipline held for each session:
  - `c3c build`
  - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main`
  - `c3c build --sanitize=address`
  - `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0,halt_on_error=1,abort_on_error=1 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main`

- Outcome:
  - preserves existing queue semantics and test contracts,
  - removes plain-integer producer-side race from multi-producer wakeup accounting.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1205/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite: pass (`Unified 1206/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite with `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP=1`: pass (`Unified 1205/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)

### Session 211 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Wakeup Full-Queue Payload Ownership

- Added scheduler regression `run_scheduler_wakeup_full_payload_ownership_boundary_tests(...)` in `src/lisp/tests_tests.c3`:
  - fills wakeup ring, attempts `WAKEUP_OFFLOAD_READY` enqueue with completion payload under forced full-queue failure,
  - frees payload on failed enqueue to lock in caller-ownership contract for enqueue failure,
  - verifies queue drain convergence, `wakeup_drops` delta, and boundary/runtime field stability.
- Wired into `run_scheduler_tests(...)`.
- Outcome:
  - codifies retry-loop ownership expectations for worker enqueue failures,
  - guards against leak/double-free regressions in full-queue producer paths.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1205/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite: pass (`Unified 1207/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite with `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP=1`: pass (`Unified 1206/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)

- Added scheduler regression `run_scheduler_inactive_offload_ready_payload_cleanup_boundary_tests(...)` in `src/lisp/tests_tests.c3`:
  - enqueues `WAKEUP_OFFLOAD_READY` with in-range fiber id targeting an inactive pending-offload slot,
  - verifies drain convergence, inactive-slot reset stability, and boundary/runtime field stability.
- Wired into `run_scheduler_tests(...)`.
- Outcome:
  - closes coverage gap for in-range inactive payload cleanup path (`scheduler_handle_wakeup_offload_ready`),
  - strengthens payload lifetime guarantees on scheduler wakeup boundaries.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1206/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite: pass (`Unified 1208/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite with `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP=1`: pass (`Unified 1207/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)

### Session 213 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Worker Retry on Full Wakeup Ring

- Added scheduler regression `run_scheduler_offload_worker_retry_full_wakeup_boundary_tests(...)` in `src/lisp/tests_tests.c3`:
  - exercises real offload-worker producer retry loop while ring is full,
  - observes retry via `wakeup_drops` delta,
  - drains ring, waits for in-range pending-offload completion delivery, consumes completion explicitly,
  - verifies queue convergence, pending-slot reset, and boundary/runtime state stability.
- Wired into `run_scheduler_tests(...)`.
- Outcome:
  - adds concurrent producer-path coverage (worker thread + scheduler consumer) to wakeup hardening block,
  - prevents regressions where retry/delivery teardown leaves completion payloads stranded.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1208/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite: pass (`Unified 1209/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite with `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP=1`: pass (`Unified 1208/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)

### Session 214 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Worker-Cancel Thread-Task Interleave

- Added scheduler regression `run_scheduler_thread_task_worker_cancel_interleave_boundary_tests(...)` in `src/lisp/tests_tests.c3`:
  - enqueues real worker offload task with explicit thread-task id,
  - immediately cancels task, then waits for completion take,
  - verifies cancel completion kind (`OFFLOAD_RES_ERROR`) + task entry cleanup,
  - verifies interpreter boundary/runtime snapshot stability.
- Wired into `run_scheduler_tests(...)`.
- Outcome:
  - extends thread-task cancel coverage from local state-machine assertions to live worker interleavings,
  - hardens completion ownership and cleanup expectations under cancel+completion races.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1208/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite: pass (`Unified 1210/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite with `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP=1`: pass (`Unified 1209/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)

### Session 215 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Thread Timeout-Then-Join Boundaries

- Added scheduler regression `run_scheduler_thread_join_timeout_then_join_boundary_tests(...)` in `src/lisp/tests_tests.c3`:
  - executes immediate timeout join on active worker task (expects timeout error + task persistence),
  - executes later bounded join on same task (expects completion + task removal),
  - verifies boundary/runtime snapshot stability.
- Wired into `run_scheduler_tests(...)`.
- Outcome:
  - hardens timeout path semantics against worker interleavings,
  - ensures timeout does not prematurely consume task state needed for later join.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1209/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite: pass (`Unified 1211/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite with `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP=1`: pass (`Unified 1210/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)

### Session 216 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Offload-Ready Barrier Payload Path

- Added scheduler regression `run_scheduler_wakeup_offload_ready_barrier_boundary_tests(...)` in `src/lisp/tests_tests.c3`:
  - stages unready slot-0 `WAKEUP_OFFLOAD_READY` payload + ready slot-1 event,
  - verifies drain barrier stop (no premature processing),
  - releases slot-0 readiness, verifies ordered delivery and pending-offload completion,
  - consumes completion and verifies slot reset + boundary/runtime stability.
- Wired into `run_scheduler_tests(...)`.
- Outcome:
  - extends ready-barrier hardening to payload-bearing wakeup events,
  - guards against offload completion loss/free-order regressions under ready-gated drains.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1210/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite: pass (`Unified 1212/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - strict ASAN full suite with `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP=1`: pass (`Unified 1211/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)

### Session 217 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Enforcement Config Externalization

- Externalized facade/sensitive policy data into dedicated files:
  - `scripts/boundary_facade_policy.txt`
  - `scripts/boundary_sensitive_files.txt`
- Updated policy scripts to consume those files:
  - `scripts/check_boundary_facade_usage.sh`
  - `scripts/check_boundary_change_policy.sh`
- Added lightweight CI guard workflow:
  - `.github/workflows/boundary-policy-guard.yml`
- Outcome:
  - policy now reviewed/edited as data files (reduced hardcoded drift risk),
  - fast guard path exists independent of full self-hosted hardening run.

### Session 218 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Boundary Surface Lock Audit

- Added policy-driven audit utility:
  - `scripts/audit_boundary_surface.sh`
  - strict mode (`OMNI_BOUNDARY_AUDIT_STRICT=1`) returns non-zero on violations.
- Generated checked-in audit snapshot:
  - `docs/BOUNDARY_SURFACE_AUDIT.md`
  - current status: `total=28`, `allowed=23`, `ignored=5`, `violations=0`.
- Outcome:
  - direct boundary surface is now measured by an auditable artifact.

### Session 219 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Final Handoff + Test Module Decomposition

- Split worker/interleave scheduler boundary regressions into dedicated module:
  - new file `src/lisp/tests_scheduler_boundary_worker.c3`
  - moved:
    - `run_scheduler_offload_worker_retry_full_wakeup_boundary_tests(...)`
    - `run_scheduler_wakeup_offload_ready_barrier_boundary_tests(...)`
    - `run_scheduler_thread_task_worker_cancel_interleave_boundary_tests(...)`
    - `run_scheduler_thread_join_timeout_then_join_boundary_tests(...)`
- Published boundary runtime audit handoff:
  - `docs/BOUNDARY_RUNTIME_AUDIT_2026-03-05.md`
- Validation:
  - facade guard: pass
  - strict boundary surface audit: pass (`violations=0`)
  - full normal suite: pass (`Unified 1212/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - full ASAN suite: pass (`Unified 1211/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
  - repeated ASAN+fiber-temp soak (3 runs): all pass (`Unified 1211/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)

### Post-44 Continuation Snapshot (Sessions 45-68)

- Boundary API expansion and caller migration completed across eval/jit/env/value/module paths.
- Scoped allocation/switch helpers consolidated (`enter/leave`, `push/pop child scope`, scoped env helpers).
- JIT/runtime lifetime hardening completed for:
  - closure env-copy paths
  - root promotion paths
  - scoped eval/finalization paths
  - constructor allocation failure paths
- Hotspot decomposition continued in scheduler/runtime modules:
  - scheduler await/cancel/join/spawn/offload paths
  - wakeup drain event handlers
  - JIT set-path and cache warm traversal helpers

### Session 106 Follow-up (2026-03-05): ASAN Stabilization

- Reproduced and fixed the ASAN fake-stack crash in escape-scope tests:
  - `AddressSanitizer CHECK failed (asan_thread.cpp:369)` with stack tail through:
    - `scope_chunk_alloc` -> `scope_create` -> `jit_copy_closure_env_if_needed` -> `jit_make_closure_from_expr`.
- Root cause:
  - JIT warm-cache compilation path (`jit_warm_expr_cache`/`jit_cache_expr`) bypassed eval-path JIT gating under ASAN.
- Remediation:
  - Added unified runtime JIT gate (`run_jit_enabled`) and applied it to top-level eval paths.
  - Gated warm-cache compilation behind the same runtime policy.
  - Disabled JIT cross-check execution in ASAN mode in unified test helpers.
  - Added deterministic JIT teardown at test end (`jit_global_shutdown`).
  - Kept mid-run JIT GC lightweight; skipped GC scheduling under ASAN to avoid unstable state-destroy cycles during execution.
- Validation:
  - `c3c build` + full test run: pass.
  - `c3c build --sanitize=address` + `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1:halt_on_error=1:abort_on_error=1` full run: pass.

### Session 107 Follow-up (2026-03-05): JIT GC Safe-Point Policy Correction

- Reproduced strict-ASAN follow-up regression:
  - leak mode: `JIT state pool full (4096)` + `2320 bytes leaked in 29 allocs` (`jit_alloc` via `jit_lookup_or_compile`)
  - crash mode: `EXIT:139` after enabling scheduling while still allowing GC call inside `jit_compile`.
- Root cause:
  - scheduling/teardown policy mismatch:
    - ASAN scheduling disabled => pool overflow + leaks
    - GC invoked from compile-time call paths => unsafe destruction context.
- Remediation:
  - moved JIT state destruction to true top-level safe points only (`run`/`run_program`/REPL `jit_gc()` calls),
  - removed `jit_gc()` call from `jit_compile()`,
  - re-enabled threshold scheduling uniformly (including ASAN),
  - kept runtime/test ASAN policy based on `main::stack_runtime_asan_enabled()`.
- Validation:
  - `c3c build` + `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main`: pass.
  - `c3c build --sanitize=address` + strict ASAN leak run (`detect_leaks=1`): pass.

### Session 108 Follow-up (2026-03-05): ASAN Pool Pressure + Parser Edge Contracts

- Added explicit JIT execution-depth accounting around generated-code calls:
  - `jit_exec_enter/jit_exec_leave`
  - enables safe-point gating for opportunistic compile-time GC.
- Increased JIT tracked-state pool headroom (`4096 -> 16384`) to avoid false overflow warnings during nested chains where GC cannot run until unwind.
- Expanded parser edge-case contract tests for refactored helper paths:
  - `export-from` specifier/module/list errors,
  - `deftype` missing-name/missing-field-name,
  - `defunion` missing-name/missing-variant-name.
- Validation:
  - Normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1154/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - Strict ASAN full suite (`detect_leaks=1`): pass (`Unified 1153/0`, `Compiler 73/0`, no pool-full warning, no leak summary failure).

### Session 109 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Persistent Env Parent Rewrite Regression

- Added boundary regression coverage for `copy_env_to_scope_inner(...)` persistent-frame parent rewrite behavior.
- New test verifies:
  - persistent env node identity is preserved across copy,
  - parent pointer is rewritten into target-scope chain (not left on releasing source parent),
  - lookups remain valid after source-scope release.
- Validation:
  - Normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1155/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - Strict ASAN full suite (`detect_leaks=1`): pass (`Unified 1154/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 110 Follow-up (2026-03-05): JIT GC Scheduling Signal Cleanup

- Reduced debug noise in `jit_track_compiled_state(...)`:
  - GC scheduling log now emits once per transition (`gc_needed` false -> true), instead of repeating on every post-threshold state.
- Behavior unchanged; this is diagnostics hardening only.
- Validation:
  - Normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1155/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - Strict ASAN full suite (`detect_leaks=1`): pass (`Unified 1154/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 111 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Test Group Isolation + Mixed Chain Rewrite Coverage

- Added test-harness group boundary reset between major unified test groups:
  - clears transient JIT/effect/error runtime state,
  - performs safe-point JIT teardown when needed.
- Added regression for mixed persistent/non-persistent env-chain rewrite under `copy_env_to_scope_inner(...)`.
- Added JIT policy assertion that boundary reset clears transient runtime state.
- Validation:
  - Normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1157/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - Strict ASAN full suite (`detect_leaks=1`): pass (`Unified 1156/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 112 Follow-up (2026-03-05): CI Summary Hook + Compiler-Phase Boundary Reset

- Added optional machine-readable summary output for unified tests:
  - `OMNI_TEST_SUMMARY=1` emits:
    - `OMNI_TEST_SUMMARY suite=unified pass=<n> fail=<n>`
- Added explicit test-group boundary reset before compiler tests to further reduce cross-suite state coupling.
- Validation:
  - Normal full suite: pass (`Unified 1157/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - Strict ASAN full suite (`detect_leaks=1`): pass (`Unified 1156/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 114 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Defer Slot Context Hardening (Clone-Safe)

- Removed persisted `StackCtx*` ownership from `Interp` defer-tracking state:
  - dropped `tco_scope_defer_ctx`,
  - retained `tco_scope_defer_slot` + `tco_scope_defer_active`.
- Updated JIT defer retarget/pop to resolve context at use-time:
  - retarget now uses `main::g_current_stack_ctx`,
  - pop now uses helper that prefers running context and falls back to caller context.
- Added invariant error path in recycle retarget:
  - `"jit: missing active stack context for call-scope defer"`.
- Rationale:
  - removes stale-pointer risk across suspend/clone/resume,
  - keeps defer identity slot-based and runtime-context driven.
- Validation:
  - `c3c build` + full suite: pass (`Unified 1157/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - `c3c build --sanitize=address` + strict ASAN (`detect_leaks=1`): pass (`Unified 1158/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 115 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Less-Brittle Instrumentation Delta Assertions

- Reduced over-constrained counter assertions in lifetime regression tests:
  - replaced exact `site_delta == 1` checks with bounded ranges (`delta_in_range(...)`) for:
    - root-boundary promotion,
    - promotion-context memo gate,
    - promotion-abort fallback gate.
- Kept strict zero-delta sentinels where they represent structural invariants:
  - cons-barrier fallback copy sites remain `== 0`.
- Rationale:
  - preserve regression signal while avoiding false failures from benign internal instrumentation reshapes.
- Validation:
  - `c3c build` + full suite: pass (`Unified 1157/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - `c3c build --sanitize=address` + strict ASAN (`detect_leaks=1`): pass (`Unified 1158/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 116 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Parser Compound-Form Helper Consolidation

- Consolidated repeated parser logic for `(<name> <param>...)` forms into:

- Migrated type/union callers:
  - `parse_deftype_name_compound(...)`
  - `parse_defunion_name_compound(...)`
  - `parse_defunion_variant_compound(...)`
- Preserved existing parser error-shape strings (`expected type name`, `expected union name`, `expected variant name`).
- Validation:
  - `c3c build` + full suite: pass (`Unified 1157/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - `c3c build --sanitize=address` + strict ASAN (`detect_leaks=1`): pass (`Unified 1158/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 117 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Parser Export-From Validation Dedup

- Performed a small parser cleanup in `parse_export_from_specifiers(...)`:
  - deduplicated repeated invalid-specifier error literal via local `spec_err`.
- Preserved parser error-shape contract and accepted forms:
  - only `'all` or `(name...)`.
- Validation:
  - `c3c build` + full suite: pass (`Unified 1157/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 118 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Stack Defer Clone-Isolation Regression

- Added stack-engine regression:
  - `test_stack_ctx_defer_update_arg_clone_isolation()`
- Verifies cloned context defer-arg retargeting is context-local:
  - clone retarget does not mutate source defer arg,
  - destroy paths invoke callbacks on the expected arg only.
- Integrated into stack test runner:
  - new output `PASS: defer update arg clone isolation`.
- Validation:
  - normal + strict ASAN runs green.
  - stack engine now reports `15 passed, 0 failed`.

### Session 119 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Parser Closing-Paren Edge Contracts

- Added focused parser edge tests for missing-close-paren forms:
  - `export-from`
  - `deftype` compound name
  - `defunion` compound name/variants
- Adjusted expected substrings for these cases to runtime-observed shape `")"` (instead of `"expected )"`), keeping assertions strict to real parser output.
- Validation:
  - normal suite green (`Unified 1160/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - strict ASAN suite green (`Unified 1160/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 120 Follow-up (2026-03-05): CI Summary Coverage for Stack/Scope Suites

  - `stack_engine` summary line emitted by `run_stack_engine_tests()`.
  - `scope_region` summary line emitted by `run_scope_region_tests()`.
- Existing unified/compiler summary behavior preserved.
- Validation:
  - normal + strict ASAN runs green.
  - summary lines now available for all major suites:
    - stack_engine, scope_region, unified, compiler.

### Session 121 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Helper-Level Quiet Mode for Unified Tests

- Added runtime-cached helper quiet policy in `run_lisp_tests()`:
  - quiet on `OMNI_TEST_QUIET=1`,
  - or on `OMNI_TEST_SUMMARY=1` unless `OMNI_TEST_VERBOSE=1`.
- Helper pass lines now route through `emit_pass(...)` and honor cached quiet state (including `test_gt`).
- Effect:
  - reduced CI log noise while preserving fail lines and summary markers.
- Validation:
  - normal + strict ASAN suites green.
  - verified quiet vs verbose summary-mode behavior via targeted runs.

### Session 122 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Stack Engine Quiet-Mode Caching

- Applied cached quiet policy to stack-engine PASS lines (avoid per-check env ambiguity):
  - `g_stack_quiet_output` computed once at `run_stack_engine_tests()` start.
- PASS output routed through `stack_print_pass(...)` and suppressed under:
  - `OMNI_TEST_QUIET=1`, or
  - `OMNI_TEST_SUMMARY=1` without `OMNI_TEST_VERBOSE=1`.
- `OMNI_TEST_SUMMARY suite=stack_engine ...` remains emitted.
- Validation:
  - normal + strict ASAN suites green.
  - summary-mode run confirms compact stack-engine output + preserved summary line.

### Session 123 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Compiler Suite Quiet-Mode PASS Gating

- Added compiler-local quiet gating (`compiler_print_pass`) using env policy:
  - `OMNI_TEST_QUIET=1`, or
  - `OMNI_TEST_SUMMARY=1` without `OMNI_TEST_VERBOSE=1`.
- Mechanically routed compiler PASS outputs through the helper.
- Outcome:
  - summary-mode CI no longer emits full compiler PASS stream by default,
  - `OMNI_TEST_VERBOSE=1` restores full PASS output when needed.
- Validation:
  - quiet/verbose behavior verified.
  - normal + strict ASAN suites remain green.

### Session 124 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Unified Harness Direct-PASS Quiet Routing

- Added `emit_pass_literal(...)` in `tests_tests.c3` and routed direct literal PASS prints through it.
- Net effect:
  - summary-mode runs avoid most custom-group PASS spam in unified suite,
  - fail lines and suite summaries remain visible.
- Validation:
  - normal and strict ASAN suites green.
  - summary-mode output compact with stable suite summary markers.

### Session 125 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Parser Helper Edge Coverage Extension

- Hardened Deduce resource teardown:
  - added `deduce_db_finalizer(...)` and wired `deduce-db` handles to close LMDB env on FFI-handle release.
- Reduced order sensitivity for Deduce suite:

  - added focused smoke + reopen/rebind stress checks:
    - `deduce 'open returns handle`
    - `deduce repeated open/rebind`
- Validation:
  - normal full suite green (`Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1168/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

  - `alias IsolatedTestGroupFn = fn void(Interp*, int*, int*)`
  - `run_group_isolated(...)`
- Updated isolated wrappers to use helper:
  - async/http/scheduler/atomic.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite green (`Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1168/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - strict ASAN full suite green (`Stack engine 14/0`, `Unified 1167/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

- Validation:
  - normal full suite green (`Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1168/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).
  - strict ASAN full suite green (`Stack engine 14/0`, `Unified 1167/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 134 Follow-up (2026-03-05): ASAN Raise-Pending Boundary Scrub

- Reproduced ASAN-only regression:
  - `tco-recycle: effects in loop` failed (`interp=FAIL`),
  - standalone handle repro returned `999` instead of `5`.
- Root cause:
  - stale `raise_pending` state leaked across top-level `run()` boundaries in interpreter/ASAN paths.
- Implemented top-level-safe scrub in `src/lisp/eval_run_pipeline.c3`:
  - added `run_clear_stale_raise_state(...)`,
  - clears only when `handler_count == 0`,
  - called at:
    - `run_program(...)` entry,
    - each `run_program(...)` expression iteration,
    - `run(...)` entry.
- Validation:
  - targeted ASAN repro now returns `5` (correct),
  - normal full suite green (`Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1168/0`, `Compiler 73/0`),
  - strict ASAN full suite green (`Stack engine 14/0`, `Unified 1167/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 135 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Isolated Group Reset Consolidation

- Reduced repetitive boundary-reset boilerplate in unified test runner.
- Added global-only helper:
  - `run_test_global_boundary_reset(...)`
- Updated isolated runner:
  - `run_group_isolated(...)` now applies global reset before/after each isolated group.
- Kept `run_test_group_boundary_reset(...)` for per-interpreter field reset and compiler-suite transition, delegating global reset to shared helper.
- Removed repeated `run_test_group_boundary_reset(interp)` calls between isolated group invocations in `run_lisp_tests()`.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite green (`Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1168/0`, `Compiler 73/0`),
  - strict ASAN full suite green (`Stack engine 14/0`, `Unified 1167/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 136 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Parser Edge Coverage Expansion

- Increased focused parser helper coverage for import/export/type edge patterns:
  - new `run_advanced_parser_import_edge_tests(...)` cases for:
    - missing `'as` in paren import specifier,
    - missing alias after `'as` (paren and symbol forms),
    - non-symbol import list element,
    - missing close paren.
  - added export-from nested-list invalid case.
  - added deftype/defunion malformed compound param and variant-name cases.
- Wired import-edge tests into module-system advanced suite.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite green (`Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`),
  - strict ASAN full suite green (`Stack engine 14/0`, `Unified 1176/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 137 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Stale Raise Regression Lock-In

- Added explicit regression test in `run_jit_policy_tests(...)`:
  - manually seeds stale `raise_pending`,
  - executes top-level `run(...)` containing `handle` with `raise` clause,
  - asserts result path is unaffected by stale state and runtime flags are scrubbed.
- New pass signal:
  - `jit policy: top-level run scrubs stale pending raise state`
- Validation:
  - normal full suite green (`Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1178/0`, `Compiler 73/0`),
  - strict ASAN full suite green (`Stack engine 14/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`).

### Session 138 Follow-up (2026-03-05): JIT Policy Test Decomposition

- Decomposed large mixed-responsibility test function:
  - `run_jit_policy_tests(...)` split into focused helpers:
    - `run_jit_policy_warm_cache_tests(...)`
    - `run_jit_policy_gc_safe_point_test(...)`
    - `run_jit_policy_boundary_reset_test(...)`
    - `run_jit_policy_stale_raise_scrub_test(...)`
- Kept behavior and pass/fail output contracts unchanged.
- Validation:
  - normal full suite green (`Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1178/0`, `Compiler 73/0`),

  - `src/lisp/eval_env_copy.c3`
- Tests are excluded from this gate (`src/lisp/tests_*.c3`) to preserve low-level regression fixtures.
- Wired guard into boundary profile:
  - `scripts/run_boundary_hardening.sh` now runs Stage 0 guard check before build/test stages.
- Validation:
  - `scripts/check_boundary_facade_usage.sh`: pass.

### Session 170 Follow-up (2026-03-05): Boundary Change Policy (ASAN Requirement)

- Added `scripts/check_boundary_change_policy.sh`:
  - detects boundary-sensitive file changes (`HEAD~1..HEAD` by default, `OMNI_BOUNDARY_POLICY_RANGE` override),
  - when boundary-sensitive changes exist, requires both normal and ASAN profile evidence:
    - `stack_engine/scope_region/unified/compiler fail=0`,
    - `fiber_temp_pool enabled=1` in both logs.
- Wired into boundary profile:
  - `scripts/run_boundary_hardening.sh` now runs Stage 7 policy check.
- Workflow support:
  - `.github/workflows/boundary-hardening.yml` adds optional `policy_range` input and forwards it as `OMNI_BOUNDARY_POLICY_RANGE`.
- Validation:

## Revision Draft (v3): Lifetime Teardown and Continuation Safety

Status:
- This section is a living revision draft for design decisions.
- It incorporates critical analysis of the multi-shot continuation cloning problem.

### Why This Revision Exists

- We still have teardown risk when suspended contexts are destroyed before normal call-scope epilogues run.
- Prior quick fixes created layer violations by leaking Lisp memory semantics (`ScopeRegion`) into stack engine internals.
- A newly discovered **latent danger** exists in multi-shot cloning: `memcpy` of the C-stack copies Lisp scope pointers but does not bump their Lisp-level refcounts, leading to silent double-frees upon eventual normal returns. We must solve the leak *and* the clone refcount problem together.

### Hard Constraints

- Keep stack engine generic. No direct `ScopeRegion` ownership logic in low-level coroutine core.
- Preserve deterministic cleanup behavior for finalizer-bearing values.
- Keep continuation clone behavior safe: absolute pointers must remain valid, and semantic ownership (refcounts) must be correctly duplicated.
- Avoid moving-GC complexity (no pointer rewriting of Lisp values on the C-stack).

### Candidate Architectures (Updated)

1. **Exception-driven unwinding (OCaml/Koka style)**
   - *Mechanism:* On destroy, resume the fiber with a special `UNWIND` signal. The JIT loop catches it and naturally unwinds through existing `scope_release` epilogues.
   - *Pros:* Zero hot-path overhead. Naturally scales to user-level `try/finally`.
   - *Cons:* High risk of violating thread-affinity if destructors run on scheduler threads. Requires deep JIT modification to separate standard errors from control-flow signals.

2. **Generic stack defer substrate with `DeferOps` VTable (Current Recommendation)**
   - *Mechanism:* Opaque defer registration (`stack_ctx_defer`) with `{ DeferOps* ops; void* arg }` semantics. `DeferOps` provides both `destroy(arg)` and `clone(arg)` callbacks. Storage strategy (intrusive stack nodes vs. inline slots) is an internal optimization choice.
   - *Pros:*
     - Solves the layer violation: `stack_engine.c3` only knows about function pointers.
     - Zero heap allocation on fast path (with suitable internal storage strategy).
     - Solves the latent clone double-free: `stack_ctx_clone` replays defer metadata and calls `ops.clone(arg)` (which the Lisp layer implements as `scope_retain`).
   - *Cons:* Mild hot-path setup cost (writing ~3 pointers per call scope).

3. **Fiber-Temp Arenas (The "Holy Grail")**
   - *Mechanism:* A 3-domain model (ROOT, ESCAPE/SCOPE, FIBER_TEMP). Ephemeral allocations bump-allocate from a chunk-pool owned by the `StackCtx`.
   - *Pros:* O(1) cleanup. Scopes naturally vanish when fibers die.
   - *Cons:* Highly complex interaction with multi-shot clones. Cloned fibers would need to freeze shared chunks and allocate from new chunks to avoid corrupting each other's state while preserving absolute pointers.

### Antithesis: The Smell in Candidate 2 (If Implemented as Intrusive C-Stack Nodes)

While Candidate 2 is the most mechanically sound immediate fix, it carries distinct architectural "smells" that we must acknowledge:

1. **Pointer Fixup Fragility:** Because `DeferNode`s live on the C-stack, a `memcpy` during `stack_ctx_clone` copies the `next` pointers exactly as they are. Those `next` pointers now point to the *original* fiber's stack memory, not the cloned stack. The stack engine will have to carefully walk and relocate these `next` pointers (similar to how it fixes `RBP` chains). This is delicate, unsafe C magic.
2. **The Heap Fallback Trap:** If a user ever allocates a `DeferNode` on the heap instead of the C-stack (e.g., inside a persistent coroutine object), the `memcpy` clone won't duplicate the node itself, but it *will* duplicate the pointer to it. Both the original and the clone will share the same heap node, destroying the intrusive list structure if either one unwinds. We would have to strictly enforce that `stack_ctx_push_defer` only accepts pointers within the `StackRegion` bounds.
3. **Semantic Mismatch:** Is "defer" solving the root problem, or just patching the symptom? The root problem is that Lisp-level call scopes are tethered to C-level control flow. The more we bind Lisp memory lifecycle to C-stack intrusive nodes, the harder it becomes to serialize continuations, move them across machines, or ever transition to a stackless VM architecture in the future.

### Recommended Sequence

**Phase A (The Mechanical Fix):**
- Adopt Candidate 2 (generic `DeferOps` substrate).
- Implement `stack_ctx_defer` and `stack_ctx_undefer` public surface.
- Define clone behavior via `DeferOps.clone` contract, independent of concrete defer storage.
- Use it to manage `ScopeRegion` release and clone-time retains.

**Phase B (The Structural Fix):**
- Once correctness is proven, evaluate Candidate 3 (Fiber-Temp Arenas) as an RnD track, not a committed endpoint.
- Any 3-domain migration proposal must first prove alignment with region-centric ownership guardrails before entering production roadmap.

### Open Questions (Resolved for this Revision)

- **Should discontinuation semantics be represented as a first-class runtime signal now, or deferred?**
  *Deferred.* Mechanical safety at the engine level (`DeferOps`) is required first.
- **What is the acceptable hot-path overhead budget for generic defer push/pop?**
  *Zero heap allocations on fast path.* Concrete storage remains an implementation detail; intrusive nodes are optional if clone-safety is proven.
- **Do we want clone-time duplication of defer metadata or shared immutable snapshots?**
  *Duplication via explicit `DeferOps.clone` hooks.* Stack clone flow must re-establish defer metadata deterministically, then let Lisp-layer `clone` hooks bump semantic ownership.
- **At what milestone does a fiber-temp domain become justified?**
  *Post-profiling, after boundary invariants hold.* Fiber arenas are the ultimate structural fix but require the boundary API to be perfectly solid first.

### Drift Audit (v3 vs. Omni Architecture)

Reference:
- `AGENTS.md` ownership/drift guardrails.
- `memory/DESTINATION_ARENA_PLAN.md` synthesis constraints.

Verdict:
- **Recommended Phase A path (generic defer substrate) is LOW drift** when kept strictly opaque.
- **Current v3 wording has LOW/MEDIUM drift risk** in one active place:
  - It frames Fiber-Temp as a likely structural endpoint; this needs explicit "RnD only" scoping to avoid ownership-model drift.

Specific drift findings:

1. Layering drift risk (medium)
- `DeferOps` itself is aligned.
- Risk appears when implementation details require stack-engine knowledge of node placement policy beyond opaque callback execution.
- Guardrail:
  - Keep stack API generic (`stack_ctx_defer(cb, arg)` + opaque storage).
  - Do not make "intrusive node on stack" part of public contract.

2. Ownership-model drift risk (medium/high if unchecked)
- Fiber-Temp language can drift toward a parallel lifetime authority.
- Guardrail:
  - Treat fiber temp as allocator backing only.
  - Lifetime authority remains region/boundary policy (`TEMP`/`ESCAPE`, retain/release invariants).

3. Clone mechanics drift risk (medium)
- Pointer-fixup-heavy design is mechanically possible but raises fragility and maintainability risk.
- Guardrail:
  - Clone semantics should be explicit, testable, and independent of node memory placement assumptions where possible.

4. Determinism drift risk (low if constrained)
- Finalizer determinism remains aligned if all finalizer-bearing objects stay in audited ESCAPE paths.
- Guardrail:
  - No FIBER_TEMP routing for finalizer-bearing values.

### Revision Actions (This Iteration)

- Keep recommendation as: **generic defer substrate first**, but relax storage strategy to "implementation detail".
- Add explicit note: intrusive stack nodes are an optimization candidate, not an architectural requirement.
- Keep Fiber-Temp in RnD lane only until:
  - boundary invariants are centrally enforced,
  - ASAN teardown matrix is stable,
  - clone/discard stress tests are green.

### Quick Go/No-Go Checklist

- Go:
  - Stack layer remains opaque and callback-driven.
  - Boundary layer owns ownership policy.
  - ASAN + targeted suspend/clone tests pass.
- No-Go:
  - Stack layer directly manipulates `ScopeRegion`.
  - New per-type RC appears for language graph values.
  - Fiber-Temp is introduced as a third ownership system.
