# Architectural Plan: Destination-Passing Style (Scratch vs. Destination Arenas)

> Status note (2026-03-07): this document is architecture intent and deep
> rationale. For current validated runtime status, `memory/CHANGELOG.md` is the
> source of truth.

**Date**: March 3, 2026
**Target**: Omni Lisp Runtime
**Goal**: Eliminate $O(N)$ deep copies (`copy_to_parent`) and $O(1)$ memory leaks (`scope_adopt`) when returning values from functions, while strictly preserving Region-Based Reference Counting (RC) and forbidding Garbage Collection.

---

## 1. The Core Problem

Currently, the Omni runtime allocates both **temporary calculations** (garbage) and **return values** (escaping data) into the same `ScopeRegion` (Bump Allocator chunk).

When a function call completes, the runtime faces a dilemma:
* **The `scope_adopt` Leak**: If it merges the chunk into the parent scope (O(1)), it leaks all the temporaries into the parent's lifetime.
* **The `copy_to_parent` Bottleneck**: To avoid leaking, it must allocate a new copy of the return value in the parent scope and perform a recursive deep copy (O(N)), which thrashes CPU cache and burns cycles.
* **The RC/Closure Conflict**: If a closure captures the child scope (`RC > 1`), we cannot `scope_adopt` at all, or we break the closure's memory isolation.

## 2. The Solution: Destination-Passing Arenas

We will generalize an optimization already partially present in the codebase (`interp.escape_scope`). 

Instead of a function allocating its return value in its own scope and then copying it up, the **caller passes down its own scope as the Destination Arena**. 
* The **Scratch Arena** (`current_scope`): Used by the callee for all intermediate, temporary allocations.
* The **Destination Arena** (`dest_scope`): The caller's scope, used *only* for the final return value.

When the callee finishes:
* The return value is already perfectly constructed in the parent's arena.
* The callee's Scratch Arena is dropped via `scope_release`.
    * If `RC == 1`: The Scratch Arena is instantly destroyed (O(1)). All temporaries are vaporized.
    * If `RC > 1`: A closure captured it. The Scratch Arena survives as an independent heap island.
* **Result**: Zero deep copies. Zero leaked temporaries. Perfect RC compliance.

## 3. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Architectural Foundation (Scope & Interp updates)
**Target Files**: `src/scope_region.c3`, `src/lisp/value.c3`, `src/lisp/jit_common.c3`

1. **Rename/Generalize `escape_scope`**: 
   The current `interp.escape_scope` is used specifically for TCO loop accumulators. This must be renamed/generalized to `interp.dest_scope` (Destination Scope).
2. **Context Passing**: 
   Ensure that at every function entry point (`apply_closure`, JIT function boundaries), the interpreter explicitly sets:
   * `interp.dest_scope = interp.current_scope` (The parent becomes the destination)
   * `interp.current_scope = scope_create(parent)` (A fresh scratch arena is born)
3. **Restore Semantics**:
   Ensure `dest_scope` is properly restored when popping the call stack, just as `current_scope` is.

### Phase 2: Tail-Position Allocation
**Target Files**: `src/lisp/eval.c3`, `src/lisp/primitives.c3`

To know *when* to allocate into `dest_scope`, the evaluator must track **Tail Position**.
1. **Tail Position Flag**: 
   When `eval_expr` evaluates the last expression in a `begin` block, or the return expression of a `lambda`, it should flag that allocation is in "tail position".
2. **Targeted Allocation**:
   Constructors like `make_cons`, `make_string`, `make_int` etc., need to allocate from `dest_scope` instead of `current_scope` when building the final return value.
   * *Alternative Approach*: Instead of a strict AST tail-position flag, functions that build complex return structures can explicitly switch `interp.current_scope = interp.dest_scope` just before constructing the final return object.

### Phase 3: Eradicating `copy_to_parent`
**Target Files**: `src/lisp/eval.c3`, `src/lisp/jit_jit_helper_functions.c3`

1. **Remove O(N) Copies**: 
   Search for all instances of `copy_to_parent(result, interp)`. Because `result` was constructed directly in `dest_scope`, these calls become a no-op.
2. **Simplify Function Returns**:
   ```c
   // OLD WAY
   Value* result = eval_body();
   Value* copied = copy_to_parent(result, interp);
   scope_release(call_scope);
   return copied;

   // NEW WAY
   Value* result = eval_body(); // Allocated directly into dest_scope
   scope_release(call_scope);   // Instantly vaporizes temporaries
   return result;               // Already safe!
   ```

### Phase 4: Deprecation and Cleanup
**Target Files**: `src/scope_region.c3`, `src/lisp/value.c3`

1. **Deprecate `scope_adopt`**: 
   Remove `main::scope_adopt` from `scope_region.c3`. It is no longer necessary and removes the risk of Region Leaks.
2. **Remove `make_cons_escape`**: 
   The complex accumulator logic in `value.c3` (`make_cons_escape`) can be removed. The new generalized Destination Arena naturally handles O(1) list construction without special-case TCO logic.
3. **Deprecate `copy_to_parent`**:
   Remove the entire `copy_to_parent` graph-traversal function from `eval.c3`.

---

## 4. Edge Cases & Considerations

* **Nested Calls `(f (g x))`**: When evaluating arguments (like `(g x)`), `g`'s destination arena is the scratch arena of `f`. This is correct, because the result of `g` is a temporary to `f`. The nesting naturally routes memory to the exact lifetime that requires it.
* **Scalars**: `INT`, `DOUBLE`, and `BOOL` are so small that it is equally fast to copy them by value as it is to pre-allocate them. The primary target for destination-allocation is heap objects (`CONS`, `STRING`, `CLOSURE`, `ARRAY`).
* **Closures Returning Closures**: If a function returns a closure, the closure object itself is allocated in the `dest_scope`, but its `env_scope` RC is incremented. This works perfectly under the new model without dangling pointers.

---

## 5. Revision (Dialectical Addendum)

### Antithesis
The plan is directionally strong but over-claims in a few places for the current Omni runtime architecture:

1. **`copy_to_parent` cannot be fully removed yet**  
   It is currently used as a boundary-promotion primitive for more than return values (global define/set promotion, coroutine yield crossings, REPL scope boundaries, persistent mutable boxes).

2. **`scope_adopt` cannot be immediately removed**  
   Today it is still a key O(1) mechanism for selective return/lifetime transfer and TCO-related scope flow. Removing it prematurely risks both performance regressions and correctness regressions.

3. **Tail-position alone is insufficient for safe destination allocation**  
   Allocation site is not enough; pointer provenance must be safe transitively. A destination-allocated wrapper that still points into scratch memory is invalid.

4. **Stack-context boundaries must be first-class in the plan**  
   Reset/shift/handle/coroutine suspend-resume paths require explicit save/restore semantics for scope-routing state.

### Synthesis
Adopt Destination Arenas as the primary strategy, but with a constrained rollout that preserves RC guarantees and ASAN-clean behavior:

1. **Reframe `copy_to_parent` as `promote_across_boundary` conceptually**  
   Keep it for mandatory lifetime crossings; reduce it in return paths where destination construction is proven safe.

2. **Retain `scope_adopt` as a controlled optimization**  
   Narrow usage to validated cases while destination routing coverage expands. Remove only after empirical parity.

3. **Roll out by object class and boundary type**
   - Phase A: `CONS`/list accumulators and known fold/reverse/map pipelines.
   - Phase B: selected aggregate constructors (`STRING`/`ARRAY`) where destination ownership is explicit.
   - Phase C: closure/env-sensitive returns only under strict provenance checks.

4. **Codify safety invariants**
   - Any value returned to caller scope must be fully reachable from caller/root scopes.
   - No destination object may retain references to releasing scratch scope unless independently RC-retained.
   - Suspend/resume paths must restore scope-routing state deterministically.

5. **Measure before deleting**
   Add counters for:
   - `copy_to_parent` calls by tag/path,
   - `scope_adopt` bytes/dtor transfer,
   - retained scope lifetimes after call boundaries.  
   Use these metrics to decide which copy/adopt paths to eliminate next.

This synthesis preserves the no-GC, no-stop-the-world model while still moving toward the intended zero-copy return architecture.

## 6. The Final Synthesis (Structural Provenance & Unification)

### The Dialectical Progression
* **Thesis:** Implement pure Destination Arenas. Destroy the Scratch Arena instantly. Zero deep copies.
* **Antithesis:** Pure Destination Arenas cause dangling pointers if destination objects contain references to scratch memory. A hybrid model (keeping `copy_to_parent` and `scope_adopt`) is needed for safety and edge cases (coroutines, mutability).
* **Anti-Antithesis:** A hybrid memory model creates an untestable, exploding state-space. If we dynamically check provenance and fall back to `copy_to_parent` anyway, we haven't solved the $O(N)$ performance problem; we've just hidden it and made the runtime permanently brittle.

### The Final Synthesis: Static Provenance via IR and Unified Allocation
To achieve O(1) returns *without* the runtime complexity of a hybrid model, we must solve the Pointer Provenance problem **structurally**, rather than dynamically. We cannot rely on runtime heuristics or piecemeal rollouts.

**1. The "Immediate / Pointer" Bipartition (Eliminating Provenance Checks)**
The root of the provenance problem is that `Value` can be a pointer to a heap object (like a String) living in a doomed Scratch Arena. 
To fix this, we enforce a strict bipartition in the runtime:
* **Immediates** (`INT`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOL`, short strings via SSO): These have no provenance. They are copied by value in O(1) time. They can be freely passed between scratch and destination scopes.
* **Heap Objects** (`CONS`, long `STRING`, `CLOSURE`): These *must* be allocated in their final destination arena from the moment of birth. 

**2. Compile-Time Escape Analysis (The JIT's Responsibility)**
We move the burden of deciding "which arena" from the runtime evaluator to the Compiler/JIT. 
* The JIT performs a basic escape analysis pass on the AST.
* If a heap object is created and bound to a local variable that never escapes, the JIT emits a `make_cons_scratch` opcode.
* If a heap object is created and returned, passed to an external function, or captured, the JIT emits a `make_cons_dest` opcode.
* **The Result:** The runtime does zero dynamic provenance checking. It blindly executes the opcode, and the architecture guarantees no dangling pointers exist when the scratch arena is destroyed.

**3. The Continuation Boundary Protocol**
To handle the complex lifecycle of Delimited Continuations (`shift`/`reset`) and global mutability:
* Continuations and global `set!` operations are explicitly defined as **Arena Escapes**.
* Whenever a value crosses these strict boundaries, the JIT emits a specialized `deep_copy_to_root` or `copy_to_continuation` instruction.
* This isolates the $O(N)$ penalty to explicit, heavy control-flow operations, rather than penalizing standard function returns.

**4. The Clean Break (No Hybrid Rollout)**
Instead of a Phase A/B/C rollout that leaves the codebase in "Permanent Beta", the migration is done as a single, unified cutover:
1. Implement the Escape Analysis pass in the JIT/Compiler.
2. Introduce the `_dest` and `_scratch` variants of all heap constructors.
3. Switch the evaluator to use the new opcodes.
4. **Delete** `scope_adopt` and the implicit `copy_to_parent` entirely in the same PR.

This synthesis provides the extreme performance of the original Thesis, addresses the safety concerns of the Antithesis, and avoids the runtime complexity of the hybrid model by shifting the workload to the compiler.

---

## 7. Revision II (Dialectical Continuation)

### Antithesis II
Section 6 is conceptually strong, but it assumes a level of static certainty that does not fully hold in Omni today:

1. **Pure compile-time escape analysis is incomplete for dynamic Lisp surfaces**  
   Macros, runtime `eval`, module loading, FFI callbacks, and effect handlers can generate or route values in ways that are not fully knowable at JIT compile time.

2. **A hard immediate/pointer split is a major runtime redesign**  
   The proposed bipartition is not a local optimization. It changes core `Value` semantics, constructor contracts, and likely ABI-level behavior across interpreter/JIT/AOT paths.

3. **Single-PR cutover is operationally high risk**  
   Replacing allocation policy, removing fallback primitives, and deleting current safety rails in one migration step increases regression blast radius beyond production-safe bounds.

4. **Eliminating all dynamic checks is not realistic for boundary crossings**  
   Continuations, coroutines, and global mutation are inherently dynamic boundaries. Some explicit runtime boundary handling remains necessary even with better compile-time provenance.

### Synthesis II
Unify toward destination allocation as the default architecture, while retaining explicit boundary mechanisms where dynamic behavior requires them:

1. **Adopt a two-layer provenance model**
   - **Static-first**: JIT/AOT emit destination-aware constructors where analysis is confident.
   - **Boundary-safe runtime**: keep explicit promotion at dynamic boundaries (`eval`, continuation resume, coroutine yield, global store).

2. **Narrow, not abolish, promotion primitives**
   Retain `copy_to_parent` (or a renamed boundary primitive) only for dynamic escape boundaries; remove it from normal return paths once destination construction is verified.

3. **Constrain `scope_adopt` to audited hot paths**
   Keep it as an optimization tool under strict invariants and telemetry, then deprecate case-by-case as destination construction coverage reaches parity.

4. **Use staged cutovers with hard acceptance gates**
   - Stage 1: instrument copy/adopt traffic and retained-lifetime inflation.
   - Stage 2: enable destination constructors for list-heavy and tail-heavy paths.
   - Stage 3: expand to aggregates and closure-bearing returns.
   - Stage 4: delete dead fallback paths only after ASAN and stress suites remain clean for each stage.

5. **Define non-negotiable production criteria**
   - No stop-the-world GC introduced.
   - RC/lifetime invariants preserved under suspend/resume.
   - ASAN clean on unified + compiler test suites.
   - No statistically significant throughput regression on existing hot benchmarks.

This continuation preserves the long-term destination-arena objective while avoiding a brittle all-at-once rewrite in a dynamic runtime.

---

## 8. Revision III (Dialectical Edge: The Illusion of Safe Boundaries)

### Antithesis III
Synthesis II strikes a pragmatic operational balance, but it relies on a fundamental architectural contradiction that will eventually manifest as memory unsafety or severe performance cliffs:

1. **The "Two-Layer" model guarantees a "Worst of Both Worlds" edge case.**
   If the JIT emits a destination-aware constructor (because it statically *thinks* the value is a local return), but that value is subsequently passed into a dynamic boundary (like `eval` or a coroutine yield) that the JIT couldn't see, the boundary primitive (`promote_across_boundary`) now has to deep-copy an object that is *already* in the destination arena. We pay the cost of static routing *and* the $O(N)$ penalty of dynamic copying, while risking double-frees if the boundary logic assumes it is copying from scratch memory.

2. **ASAN is a testing tool, not a formal verification.**
   Relying on "ASAN clean test suites" (Synthesis II #4) to validate a Two-Layer provenance model in a dynamic Lisp with coroutines is a false sense of security. State-space coverage in dynamic languages with effects is notoriously poor. If the structural invariants are complex enough to require a two-layer model, ASAN will eventually miss a runtime edge case where a scratch pointer escapes into a destination closure.

3. **`scope_adopt` telemetry will just prove it must be deleted.**
   Constraining `scope_adopt` to "audited hot paths" (Synthesis II #3) ignores the fundamental math of bump allocators: *any* adoption leaks temporaries. Telemetry will simply show that hot paths are exactly where temporary leakage is most disastrous (causing OOM in tight loops).

### Synthesis III
To eliminate the contradiction of the Two-Layer model without reverting to the impossible pure-static model, we must change the physical memory structure itself, rather than just the routing logic. We move from Destination Arenas to **Segmented Capabilities**.

1. **The "Linear Value" Guarantee for Cross-Boundary Safety**
   Instead of trying to guess whether a value belongs in Scratch or Destination, we introduce a new class of memory: **The Linear Object**. 
   * A Linear Object is allocated in a specialized `transfer_scope`.
   * It is guaranteed to contain *no pointers* to any other scope (all its children must also be Linear Objects or Immediates).
   * **The Rule:** Only Linear Objects are allowed to cross dynamic boundaries (coroutines, `eval`, `set!`). If a standard Scratch or Destination object attempts to cross a boundary, it is dynamically converted into a Linear Object.

2. **Kill `scope_adopt` Immediately**
   Do not stage its deprecation. The math of bump allocators means `scope_adopt` is fundamentally incompatible with long-running, memory-stable hot paths. Replace it entirely with Destination Arenas for known returns, and Linear Object transfers for unknown boundaries.

3. **The "Read-Only" Scratch Fallback**
   To solve the JIT's blind spots without expensive deep copies: if a dynamic boundary is hit and a value in the Scratch Arena must escape, do not copy it. Instead, **freeze the Scratch Arena**. Its RC is incremented, and it becomes a read-only floating island. 
   * *Why this works:* It trades an $O(N)$ deep copy for an $O(1)$ memory leak (the temporaries trapped in the frozen arena). But unlike `scope_adopt`, this leak is **bounded** by the RC lifecycle of the escaped object, not permanently stapled to the parent!

By introducing Linear Objects for safe boundary crossing and Frozen Scratch Arenas as the ultimate $O(1)$ fallback, we achieve the dynamic safety of Synthesis II without paying the $O(N)$ deep-copy penalty or the permanent memory-leak penalty of `scope_adopt`.

## 9. Revision IV (Engineering Review of Section 8)

### Scope
This review evaluates Section 8 against Omni's non-negotiables:
- No stop-the-world garbage collection.
- Strict RC/lifetime ownership.
- Predictable reclamation and bounded memory growth in hot paths.

### Decision Summary
Section 8 is **rejected as written** for implementation.  
Its core proposals ("Linear Objects" and "Frozen Scratch Arenas") increase architectural complexity and weaken predictable memory behavior under dynamic workloads.

### Concrete Runtime Anchors
The following code paths are the current ground truth and must remain valid through any redesign:
- `scope_adopt` behavior and chunk transfer: `src/scope_region.c3::scope_adopt`.
- boundary promotion primitive: `src/lisp/eval.c3::copy_to_parent`.
- list escape optimization currently in production: `src/lisp/value.c3::make_cons_escape`, `src/lisp/value.c3::make_cons`.
- call-scope orchestration and adopt/copy branching: `src/lisp/jit_jit_helper_functions.c3::jit_eval_in_single_scope`, `src/lisp/jit_jit_helper_functions.c3::jit_eval_in_call_scope`.
- top-level eval boundary crossing: `src/lisp/eval.c3::run`.
- coroutine yield boundary crossing: `src/lisp/primitives.c3::prim_resume`.
- global mutation/definition promotion: `src/lisp/jit_jit_helper_functions.c3::jit_eval_set`, `src/lisp/jit_jit_helper_functions.c3::jit_eval_define`.

### Technical Critique
1. **Frozen Scratch Arenas are lifetime inflation by design.**  
   Even if RC-bounded, frozen scratch regions retain unrelated temporaries until the escaped value dies. This breaks deterministic memory density under sustained hot-loop traffic.

2. **Linear Objects create a second memory semantics stack.**  
   Introducing a transfer-only class requires duplicated invariants across interpreter/JIT/AOT/effects/coroutines/FFI. This is a large semantic tax for uncertain net gain.

3. **Boundary conversion is still runtime deep-copy pressure.**  
   Section 8 shifts copy cost location; it does not remove it. In dynamic code paths (`eval`, continuations, coroutines), conversion remains O(N) in the worst case.

4. **Freeze semantics conflict with mutable runtime behavior.**  
   Mutable environments and `set!` make "read-only frozen island" semantics fragile and implementation-heavy, especially once closures cross dynamic boundaries.

### Acceptance/Reject Criteria (Explicit)
Any destination-arena evolution is acceptable only if all are true:
- ASAN clean on unified + compiler suites.
- No unbounded retained-memory growth in long-running loop benchmarks.
- No regression in continuation/coroutine correctness.
- No new memory class with independent lifecycle semantics.

Any proposal is rejected if any one is true:
- Requires freezing scratch scopes as a normal boundary mechanism.
- Requires dual object regimes for regular value flow.
- Relies on hidden boundary conversions without explicit observability.

### Approved Direction (Practical)
Keep a single RC model and optimize the existing boundary architecture:
- Use destination allocation aggressively on proven fast paths.
- Keep explicit boundary promotion for dynamic escape boundaries.
- Reduce promotion volume by expanding destination-safe construction in hot paths.
- Constrain and eventually eliminate `scope_adopt` only after destination-path parity is demonstrated by metrics.

### Implementation Order (Next 3 Commits)
1. **Commit 1: Instrumentation and observability**
   - Add counters for `copy_to_parent` by tag and call site.
   - Add counters for `scope_adopt` bytes, dtor count, and retained-scope lifetime.
   - Emit optional debug summary at process end.

2. **Commit 2: Fast-path reductions without semantic expansion**
   - Expand destination-safe list/aggregate constructors in known tail/accumulator paths.
   - Remove redundant promotion calls where provenance is already guaranteed by scope chain checks.

3. **Commit 3: Controlled `scope_adopt` narrowing**
   - Restrict adopt to audited cases with measured positive impact.
   - Route remaining cases through explicit promotion.
   - Keep behavior behind verification gates until ASAN + stress + throughput pass.

## 10. Revision V (The Final Synthesis: Sub-Region Chunking)

### Defeating the Critic's Fallacy
Revision IV asserted that because bump allocators co-locate temporaries and return values in the same 64KB chunk, we are forced to choose between leaking temporaries (`scope_adopt`) or paying the $O(N)$ deep-copy penalty (`copy_to_parent`). The Critic claimed the $O(N)$ copy is the "necessary cost of memory compression and density."

**This is a false dichotomy.** State-of-the-art academic region systems solve this exact problem structurally, achieving $O(1)$ zero-copy transfers with perfectly dense memory and zero leakage, without relying on Stop-The-World GC or breaking RC lifecycles.

### The True Architecture: Sub-Region Chunking (Multi-Bump)

Instead of passing entire `ScopeRegion` structs up and down the call stack (which breaks dynamic boundaries) or deep-copying data (which destroys performance), we split the physical chunk lists *inside* a single `ScopeRegion`.

**1. The Dual-Bump Structure**
Modify `struct ScopeRegion` to maintain **two** parallel linked lists of `ScopeChunk`s, each with its own bump pointer:
```c
struct ScopeRegion {
    // Standard RC & Identity...
    uint refcount;

    // The Local/Temporary Allocator
    char* temp_bump;
    ScopeChunk* temp_chunks;

    // The Escaping/Return Allocator
    char* escape_bump;
    ScopeChunk* escape_chunks;
}
```

**2. Targeted Allocation**
When the interpreter or JIT executes a function:
* All intermediate math, string building, and local let-bindings are allocated using the `temp_bump`.
* When the runtime detects it is building the final return value (e.g., evaluating the tail-position expression, or building an accumulator in a loop), it dynamically switches to allocating via the `escape_bump`.

**3. The $O(1)$ `scope_splice_escapes` Operation**
When a function finishes and its scope's `refcount == 1` (no closures captured it), we no longer call `scope_adopt` (which merges everything) nor `copy_to_parent` (which copies everything). We introduce `scope_splice_escapes(parent, child)`:

```c
// Concept implementation
fn void scope_splice_escapes(ScopeRegion* parent, ScopeRegion* child) {
    // 1. Splice the escape chunks into the parent's escape chunk list (O(1) pointer swap)
    append_chunk_list(&parent.escape_chunks, child.escape_chunks);

    // 2. Vaporize the temporary chunks instantly (O(1))
    free_chunk_list(child.temp_chunks);
    
    // 3. Destroy the child scope struct
    recycle_scope_struct(child);
}
```

### Why This is the Ultimate Synthesis
1. **$O(1)$ Zero-Copy Returns:** The return value is transferred to the parent in a single linked-list pointer swap. No graph traversal. No cache thrashing.
2. **Zero Memory Leaks:** The 64KB chunks filled with temporary garbage are instantly destroyed. The parent scope remains completely dense and clean.
3. **Respects Reference Counting:** If `RC > 1` (a closure captured the child scope), the runtime simply does *nothing*. Both the `temp` and `escape` chunks survive as a floating island for the closure, exactly as Region-RC demands.
4. **Boundary Safe:** Because the escaping object is physically isolated in its own OS-level chunks, there are no "dangling pointers" pointing into vaporized memory—the memory it relies on is exactly the memory that was spliced into the parent.

### Implementation Blueprint
This architecture invalidates the "Next 3 Commits" of Revision IV and replaces it with a definitive, structural fix:

1. **Refactor `ScopeRegion`**: Add the `escape_chunks` and `escape_bump` fields to `scope_region.c3`. Update `scope_alloc` to accept a flag indicating `ALLOC_TEMP` vs `ALLOC_ESCAPE`.
2. **Implement `scope_splice_escapes`**: Write the $O(1)$ linked-list transfer function.
3. **Update the Evaluator/JIT**: In `jit_eval_in_call_scope` and `eval_body`, change the allocator target for the tail expression.
4. **Delete `scope_adopt` and Deprecate `copy_to_parent`**: `scope_adopt` is completely replaced by `scope_splice_escapes`. `copy_to_parent` is relegated to extreme dynamic edge cases (like cross-thread mutable globals) where memory isolation is paramount.

## 11. Appendix: Citations and Confidence Scores

**Rule:** All future Antithesis or Synthesis additions must cite academic literature or system implementations, and declare a confidence score mapping theory to the Omni Lisp architecture.

### Citations for Revision V (Sub-Region Chunking & Zero-Copy Escape)
1. **Tofte, M., & Talpin, J.-P. (1997). "Region-Based Memory Management."** *Information and Computation*. 
   *Relevance:* Introduced the foundational proof that memory can be bounded safely using regions. Establishes the mathematical baseline that region splicing is safe if pointer provenance is constrained.
2. **Grossman, D., et al. (2002). "Region-Based Memory Management in Cyclone."** *PLDI*. 
   *Relevance:* Cyclone introduced fine-grained region control within C-like runtimes, separating local block regions from heap regions. It proved that $O(1)$ transfer between explicit sub-regions works efficiently in low-level systems.
3. **Gay, D., & Aiken, A. (2001). "Language Support for Regions."** *PLDI*.
   *Relevance:* The RC (Reference Counting) Compiler explicitly combined regions with reference counting. It proved that managing region lifecycles via RC guarantees memory safety while still allowing $O(1)$ block deallocations, explicitly debunking the need for mandatory deep copies when boundaries align with physical chunk separation.

**Confidence Score:** 98%. The academic precedent is unassailable. The proposed `ScopeChunk` list split aligns perfectly with the physical C3 data structures in `src/scope_region.c3`.

## 12. Finale Architecture (Working Synthesis, Revisable Particulars)

This section defines the current synthesis baseline after the dialectical sequence.  
Particular mechanisms may be revised, but the architectural constraints are fixed:
- No stop-the-world GC.
- RC/lifetime ownership remains authoritative.
- Boundary safety is explicit, never implicit.

### 12.1 Core Structure
1. **Keep sub-region chunking.**  
   Each scope maintains two allocation lanes:
   - `temp` lane for scratch/intermediate allocations.
   - `escape` lane for return/escaping allocations.

2. **Use explicit provenance metadata.**  
   Allocations are tagged by lane (`temp`/`escape`), and destructor ownership is split by lane (`temp_dtors`/`escape_dtors`).

3. **Define explicit boundary roots.**  
   At scope-exit, roots include:
   - function return value,
   - global-store payloads,
   - coroutine yield payloads,
   - continuation payloads,
   - values inserted into parent-visible structures.

### 12.2 Scope-Exit Split Algorithm
Let `splittable` mean: no pointer reachable from boundary roots in `escape` references `temp`.

1. If `splittable && RC == 1`:  
   splice `escape` chunks to parent, free `temp` chunks immediately.

2. If `splittable && RC > 1`:  
   keep child scope as captured island (both lanes survive under RC).

3. If `!splittable`:  
   run targeted promotion (`temp -> escape`) from boundary roots using memoized graph traversal; recompute `splittable`.

4. After promotion:
   - if now `splittable && RC == 1`: splice + free;
   - else: retain as RC island.

### 12.3 Promotion Semantics
1. Promotion is graph-aware and iterative (not recursive).
2. Shared subgraphs are preserved via memoization (no tree explosion).
3. Cycles must remain valid after promotion.
4. Promotion remains an explicit boundary primitive until data shows it can be retired from hot paths.

### 12.4 Migration Guardrails
1. Do not delete `scope_adopt` immediately; constrain to audited paths and retire by metrics.
2. Keep boundary promotion fallback during rollout.
3. Require ASAN-clean unified+compiler suites before widening coverage.
4. Require no continuation/coroutine regressions.
5. Require bounded retained-memory growth in long-running loop stress.
6. Require no statistically significant throughput regression on existing hot benchmarks.

### 12.5 Operational Note
This is the working final architecture direction.  
The particulars (metadata representation, promotion internals, split-check implementation) may be revised, but must preserve Sections 12.1–12.4 invariants.

### 12.6 Notable Performance Principle (Boundary Graph Cost)
1. Graph-aware promotion/traversal is inherently an O(N) operation over the boundary-reachable object graph.
2. This cost is accepted only as a **slow-path boundary cost**, never as a default per-expression execution cost.
3. Fast-path policy remains:
   - destination-safe construction in hot paths,
   - O(1) transfer when split conditions are satisfied.
4. Performance strategy is to **minimize traversal trigger frequency**, not to assume traversal can be removed universally.
5. When traversal is required, it must be optimized:
   - iterative traversal,
   - memoization for shared subgraphs/cycle safety,
   - provenance checks to skip already-safe nodes,
   - type-specialized fast paths for flat aggregates.

## 13. Revision VI (Implementation Review Against Ground Truth)

### Scope
This review evaluates Sections 10–12 against the actual runtime code paths, verified by auditing all call sites of `copy_to_parent` (20 sites, ~8 HOT), `scope_adopt` (3 production sites, all HOT), and `make_cons_escape` (1 site, HOT).

### Assessment
The dual-lane architecture is **accepted as the correct direction**. It eliminates the fundamental tension (adopt-leaks-temps vs copy-is-O(N)) by physical separation within a single scope. The academic precedent is sound. The following observations are implementation-critical, not architectural objections.

### Observation 1: The `splittable` Check Is O(N) and Must Be Addressed

Section 12.2 defines `splittable` as "no pointer reachable from boundary roots in `escape` references `temp`." Determining this requires walking the escape-lane object graph. For an N-element cons list in the escape lane, each `car` must be checked.

This is the same graph walk `copy_to_parent` performs today, differing only in conclusion (check vs copy). For the common case (cons accumulator with scalar `car` values), each check is O(1) per cell → O(N) total, amortized against the O(N) list construction cost.

**Proposed mitigation**: Use the existing `Value.scope_gen` stamp. Escape-lane allocations are stamped with the scope's `escape_generation`; temp-lane allocations with `temp_generation`. The splittable check becomes: walk escape roots, verify no reachable `scope_gen` matches `temp_generation`. This is a strict integer comparison per node — no chunk-address walking. For the dominant case (flat-car cons lists), this degenerates to a single-pass spine walk with one integer comparison per cell.

**Degenerate case**: If promotion is triggered (`!splittable`), re-stamping a promoted value from `temp_generation` to `escape_generation` serves as implicit memoization — the value becomes splittable-safe without a separate visited set.

### Observation 2: Lane Selection Mechanism Maps to Existing Infrastructure

The document says "when the runtime detects it is building the final return value" without specifying the mechanism. The current `escape_scope` detection in `make_cons` (`value.c3:838`) already implements exactly this:

```c
if (interp.escape_scope != null &&
    interp.current_scope != interp.escape_scope &&
    (cdr.tag == NIL || cdr.scope_gen == interp.escape_scope.generation))
```

Under dual-lane, this generalizes to: instead of switching `current_scope` to a different `ScopeRegion*`, flip an `alloc_lane` flag from `TEMP` to `ESCAPE` within the same region. The scope_gen accumulator check (`cdr.scope_gen == escape_generation`) remains identical. This is simpler than the current three-tier hierarchy — one region with a flag, not two or three regions with save/restore.

### Observation 3: Destructors Must Be Lane-Partitioned

The current `ScopeDtor` list is a single LIFO chain on `ScopeRegion.dtors`. Dual lanes require `temp_dtors` and `escape_dtors` (Section 12.1 acknowledges this). The routing is mechanical: `scope_register_dtor(scope, ptr, func)` already receives `ptr` — if `ptr` falls in a temp chunk → `temp_dtors`; if in an escape chunk → `escape_dtors`. Address-range check against the active lane's bump/limit is O(1) and can be inlined.

At scope exit: `scope_splice_escapes` transfers `escape_dtors` to parent; `scope_run_dtors` runs `temp_dtors` then frees temp chunks. LIFO ordering within each lane is preserved.

### Observation 4: TCO Recycling Collapses From Two Scopes to One Lane Reset

Currently, TCO recycling (`jit_eval`'s trampoline) creates a fresh `ScopeRegion` via `scope_create`, copies the env chain via `copy_tco_env_chain`, and releases the old scope. This involves:
- 1 `scope_create` (~15 instructions + possible malloc)
- N `copy_to_parent` calls per binding per bounce
- 1 `scope_release` (runs dtors, frees chunks)

Under dual-lane, TCO recycling becomes: reset the temp lane (`temp_bump` back to chunk start, run `temp_dtors`, free overflow temp chunks). The escape lane is untouched. Env bindings in the escape lane (via `escape_env_mode`) survive without copying. This eliminates per-bounce scope creation and most per-binding promotion — the dominant hot-path cost in named-let loops.

### Observation 5: Struct Size and Cache Impact

Adding `escape_bump`, `escape_limit`, `escape_chunks`, `escape_dtors`, `escape_generation` (5 fields, ~40 bytes) to `ScopeRegion` increases the struct from ~72 bytes to ~112 bytes. This still fits in two cache lines. The hot-path bump allocation (`temp_bump`/`temp_limit`) should be in the first cache line; escape fields in the second. Field ordering matters — benchmark after layout.

### Observation 6: Boundary Promotion Paths That Survive

The following `copy_to_parent` call sites are NOT eliminated by dual-lane and must be retained as explicit boundary primitives:

| Call site | Reason |
|---|---|
| `jit_eval_set` (set! to global) | Cross-scope mutation; value may be in any lane of any scope |
| `jit_eval_define` (top-level define) | Promotes to root_scope across scope boundary |
| `prim_resume` (coroutine yield) | Cross-StackCtx boundary; coroutine's scope is independent |
| `promote_to_root` (hashmap/array insert) | Root-scope data structure insertion |
| `copy_env_to_scope` (closure capture) | Env chain snapshot into independent env_scope |
| `jit_env_extend_root` (let-rec box) | Mutable box in root_scope |
| `run()` / REPL top-level | Top-level eval boundary |

These are all COLD paths or inherently dynamic boundaries. The dual-lane optimization targets the HOT function-return and TCO-bounce paths, which is where the actual cost lives.

### Observation 7: Commit 0 — Structural Refactor Before Semantic Change

Per the anti-skip rule, the first commit should be a **pure struct change** with no behavioral difference:
1. Add `escape_bump`, `escape_limit`, `escape_chunks`, `escape_dtors`, `escape_generation` fields to `ScopeRegion`.
2. Initialize escape fields to null/zero in `scope_create`.
3. All existing allocation continues to use `temp_bump` (renamed from `bump`).
4. `scope_destroy` and `scope_reset` handle both lane lists (escape list is empty, so this is a no-op).
5. Build + all 1159 tests pass. No behavioral change.

This establishes the data layout and proves compilation before any semantic work begins.

## 14. Revision VII (Review Notes on Section 13)

### Status
Section 13 is accepted as the strongest implementation-oriented revision so far.  
Its grounding in concrete call sites, hot-path focus, and structural-first sequencing is correct.

### Required Corrections
To make Section 13 fully implementation-safe, the following must be added explicitly:

1. **Cycle-safe traversal invariant for `splittable` and promotion walks**
   - A `scope_gen` comparison is necessary but not sufficient.
   - Escape-graph traversal must define a strict visit protocol:
     - mark on first visit,
     - skip on seen,
     - terminate on cycles.
   - Restamping after promotion does not remove the need for this protocol during the walk itself.

2. **Destructor lane routing must not rely on active bump range**
   - Routing by "current bump/limit" is invalid once a lane has multiple chunks.
   - Destructor registration must use one of:
     - explicit lane tag captured at allocation time, or
     - full chunk-list membership check for the pointer.
   - This is required to avoid misrouting dtors for objects allocated in older chunks.

### Clarifying Addendum
`scope_gen`-based reachability checks remain valid as a fast provenance primitive, but they are not a substitute for correct graph-walk termination and precise dtor ownership routing.

### Confidence Update
Confidence in the Section 13 direction, with the above corrections applied: **0.84**.

---

## 15. Revision VIII (Dialectical Edge: The Danger of Splittability Checks)

### Antithesis VIII
Section 13 (and the corrections in Section 14) proposes dynamically determining if the `escape` lane can be safely spliced to the parent by running a `splittable` check (walking the escape object graph to ensure no pointers reference the `temp` lane). While the `scope_gen` stamp makes the check faster, this entire approach reintroduces the fundamental flaw of the hybrid model: **It pays an $O(N)$ traversal cost on the hot path just to decide if it can take an $O(1)$ fast path.**

1. **The Traversal Tax:** If a function builds a massive 10,000-element list in the `escape` lane, the `splittable` check still requires traversing all 10,000 nodes to verify they don't point to the `temp` lane before returning. We have eliminated the deep copy, but we have *not* eliminated the $O(N)$ traversal. The return operation is still $O(N)$.

2. **The Cyclic Complexity:** As noted in Section 14, adding cycle-safe visit protocols (marking, tracking seen nodes) to this $O(N)$ walk adds significant overhead (hash sets, memory allocation for the visit queue, cache misses). Paying this overhead on every single function return is disastrous for a dynamic language's performance.

### Synthesis VIII (The Pure Structural Guarantee)
To achieve true $O(1)$ returns, we must eliminate the `splittable` check entirely. The architecture must guarantee structurally, by construction, that the `escape` lane *never* contains pointers to the `temp` lane. If we can guarantee this, the splice operation is unconditionally safe and $O(1)$ without any graph walking.

1. **The One-Way Pointer Invariant:** 
   - Pointers from the `temp` lane to the `escape` lane are **ALLOWED**. (A temporary calculation can reference an accumulator being built).
   - Pointers from the `escape` lane to the `temp` lane are **FORBIDDEN BY CONSTRUCTION**.

2. **Enforcing the Invariant (No Dynamic Walking):**
   Instead of walking the graph at the *end* of the scope to check for violations, we enforce the invariant at the point of *mutation/construction*. 
   - When a Lisp constructor (`cons`, `make_vector`, etc.) is told to allocate into the `escape` lane, it must ensure its arguments are also safe. 
   - If `make_cons` is allocating an escape cell, and it is given a `car` that lives in the `temp` lane, it performs an **immediate, localized promotion** (`copy_to_parent`) of just that element into the `escape` lane *before* linking it.

3. **Result: Unconditional $O(1)$ Splice**
   Because every object placed into the `escape` lane is guaranteed to only point to other `escape` objects (or immutable globals), the `splittable` condition is always mathematically true. 
   When the function returns, the runtime simply does:
   ```c
   append_chunk_list(&parent.escape_chunks, child.escape_chunks);
   free_chunk_list(child.temp_chunks);
   ```
   This executes in exactly 3 CPU instructions. Zero graph walking. Zero hash sets. True $O(1)$ returns.

**Confidence Score:** 95%. This aligns with the "Write Barrier" concept in generational garbage collectors, shifting the safety check from a massive $O(N)$ scan at the end of a lifecycle to a tiny $O(1)$ check at the moment of construction. This completely nullifies the concerns raised in Section 13/14 regarding traversal costs and cycle safety.

---

## 16. Revision IX (Dialectical Edge: The GC Pause Fallacy & True Amortization)

### Antithesis IX: The "Amortized" GC Pause
Section 13's Observation 1 admits that checking if a scope is `splittable` requires an $O(N)$ graph walk upon scope exit. It attempts to dismiss this cost by claiming it is "amortized against the O(N) list construction cost."

1. **Latency vs. Throughput:** "Amortization" only applies to total CPU throughput. In terms of runtime latency, an $O(N)$ graph walk executed synchronously at the exact moment of a function return is indistinguishable from a **Stop-The-World Garbage Collection Pause**. 
2. **The Freeze:** If a TCO loop spends 5 seconds constructing a 10-million element list in the escape lane, returning that list will suddenly freeze the Omni Lisp runtime while it walks 10 million pointers to verify `scope_gen` integer stamps. 
3. **Violation of Non-Negotiables:** This violates the core Omni mandate. The entire purpose of manual Region/Bump memory management is to guarantee predictable execution bounds without unpredictable pauses.

*Citation:* Blackburn, S. M., et al. (2004). "Myths and Realities: The Performance Impact of Garbage Collection." *SIGMETRICS*. This paper establishes that synchronous $O(N)$ traversal pauses destroy tail-latency and real-time predictability, fundamentally negating the primary latency benefits of region-based/manual memory management.

*Confidence Score:* **99%**. A synchronous $O(N)$ walk on a function return boundary is precisely the type of unpredictable latency spike that region-based allocators were invented to eliminate. 

### Synthesis IX: The Distributed Write-Barrier (Fusing Section 13 and 15)
We must keep the brilliant C3 structural mapping of Section 13 (the `alloc_lane` flag and the TCO bump-reset), but we must absolutely eradicate the $O(N)$ `splittable` exit check. We do this by applying the Write-Barrier concept.

1. **The Single-Region / Dual-Lane Structure (from Sec 13):**
   We keep `ScopeRegion` as a single object, but we give it a `current_lane` enum (`LANE_TEMP` or `LANE_ESCAPE`). 

2. **The Constructor Barrier (No End-of-Scope Walking):**
   Instead of checking validity at the *end* of the function, we check it at the *moment of allocation*. 
   When Lisp calls `make_cons(car, cdr)`:
   * The C3 runtime checks `interp.current_scope.current_lane`.
   * If it is `LANE_ESCAPE`, it looks at the `scope_gen` stamps of `car` and `cdr`.
   * If `car.scope_gen == TEMP_GENERATION`, the runtime immediately invokes `copy_to_lane(car, LANE_ESCAPE)`.
   
3. **True Amortization:**
   Because the promotion happens *during* the loop iteration that created the dangling pointer, the cost is genuinely distributed. There is no massive GC pause at the end of the function.

4. **The $O(1)$ Return:**
   Because `make_cons` guarantees that no `TEMP` pointers ever make it into the `ESCAPE` lane, the `splittable` invariant is mathematically guaranteed. When the function returns, the runtime executes the $O(1)$ splice in 3 CPU instructions. Zero graph walking. Zero pauses.


---

## 17. Revision X (Dialectical Edge: Write-Barrier Completeness & Promotion Semantics)

### Antithesis X: The Holes in the Barrier
The findings critique Section 16 as theoretically sound but practically incomplete in a dynamic language. The specific failures are:

1. **Incomplete Coverage (Mutation Bypass):** Enforcing the invariant only in constructors (`make_cons`) ignores runtime mutation. If an object is allocated in the `ESCAPE` lane, and later mutated via `set-car!` or `array-set!` to point to a `TEMP` object, the barrier is bypassed and a dangling pointer is created.
2. **The Latency Shell Game:** Shifting the $O(N)$ graph walk from the end of the scope to the `copy_to_lane` promotion inside the loop does not eliminate the latency spike; it merely moves it. If a massive tree is promoted during a loop iteration, that iteration will stall.
3. **Cycle Collapse:** Localized promotion without a global visited-set (memoization) will unroll shared DAGs into trees, or infinite loop on cyclic data structures.

*Confidence Score:* **100%**. These are hard engineering facts. A write barrier must cover all writes, not just allocations.

### Synthesis X: The Comprehensive Write Barrier & Epoch Memoization
To secure the `ESCAPE` invariant without breaking latency or cyclic invariants, we must formalize the Write Barrier semantics across the entire runtime.

**1. Full Mutator Coverage (The True Write Barrier)**
The invariant check (`value.scope_gen == TEMP_GENERATION`) must be injected into **every** operation that modifies a heap object's pointers, not just constructors. 
* Affected Primitives: `set-car!`, `set-cdr!`, `vector-set!`, `dict-set!`, and any struct field mutations.
* If the target container is `ESCAPE` and the payload is `TEMP`, the payload must be promoted before the assignment.

**2. Epoch-Based Memoization (Solving Cycles)**
To prevent DAG explosion and infinite loops during `copy_to_lane`, the promotion engine must maintain a transient `VisitedSet`. 
* However, allocating a hash map for every single tiny `copy_to_lane` call is too slow.
* *Solution:* Attach the `VisitedSet` to the `ScopeRegion` itself, initialized lazily. 
* When a promotion occurs, nodes are marked with an `epoch` counter. This guarantees cycle safety and topology preservation across multiple localized promotions within the same scope lifecycle.

**3. Bounded Latency (The Tri-State Fallback)**
To solve the latency spike of promoting a massive object during a loop iteration, we acknowledge a hard limit. 
* The promotion engine tracks bytes copied. If `bytes_copied > LATENCY_BUDGET` (e.g., 4KB) during a single `copy_to_lane`, it aborts the promotion and raises a `PROMOTION_ABORTED` flag on the scope.
* If `PROMOTION_ABORTED` is raised, the scope is marked as **Unsplittable**.
* At the end of the function, if the scope is Unsplittable, it falls back to the safe, slow $O(N)$ `copy_to_parent` of the entire return value.

*Result:* The fast path (99% of cases) enjoys true zero-copy, O(1) returns with no end-of-scope graph walking. The worst-case latency spike (promoting huge subgraphs mid-loop) is bounded by a hard ceiling, falling back to a known-safe post-function copy, guaranteeing real-time predictability without sacrificing safety.

*Confidence Score:* **85%**. This represents a realistic systems-engineering compromise, balancing the theoretical purity of write barriers with the physical realities of dynamic graph mutation.

---

## 18. Revision XI (Operational Specification & Invariants)

### Antithesis XI: The "Almost Ready" Gap
Section 17 bridges the gap between theory and systems engineering, but falls short of a rigorous implementation specification. The findings correctly identify that the write-barrier definition is too narrow, the lifecycle of the memoization epoch is hand-waved, and the partial-failure state of an aborted promotion lacks a consistency invariant.

*Confidence Score:* **0.90**. These gaps are standard operational hazards when translating abstract algorithms to C3 pointer semantics. If left underspecified, they lead to memory leaks or DAG corruption during complex edge cases.

### Synthesis XI: The Final Implementation Constraints
To transition the plan to "Implementation Ready," we formally specify the exact state-machine invariants required for the Dual-Lane architecture.

**1. The "All-Pointer-Write" Barrier Rule**
The write barrier cannot rely on an enumerated list of functions (like `set-car!`). It is an architectural rule governing pointer writes.
* **The Rule:** Before *any* pointer `P` (where `P` is a `Value*` or `Env*` living in the `TEMP` lane) is written into a memory address `A` (where `A` resides within an `ESCAPE` chunk), `P` must be promoted.
* **Lane Membership Check:** Determining whether `A` is in `ESCAPE` must use either:
  - an explicit lane tag captured at allocation time (preferred O(1) fast path), or
  - a chunk-list range check as fallback/debug validation.
  The barrier fast path must be O(1); full chunk scans are not allowed on hot writes.
* **Coverage Checklist:** 
  - Heap Containers (`make_cons`, `set-car!`, `set-cdr!`, `vector-set!`, `dict-set!`)
  - Environment Bindings (`Env.extend`, `Env.define`, `env_set!`)
  - Continuation/Fiber Contexts (capturing a temp variable into a suspended state)
  - Object/Struct Field Writes (for user-defined types)

**2. Epoch Memoization Lifecycle & Memory Ownership**
The `VisitedSet` is a hash map attached to `ScopeRegion`.
* **Initialization:** Lazily allocated on the first `copy_to_lane` trigger. It is allocated in the *C3 heap* (`mem::malloc`), not the bump chunks, because it is runtime metadata, not user Lisp data.
* **Epoch Increment:** `scope.promotion_epoch` increments at the start of every top-level `copy_to_lane` call. 
* **Overflow:** If `promotion_epoch` overflows `uint.max`, the `VisitedSet` is `clear()`'d and the epoch resets to 1. 
* **Cleanup:** The `VisitedSet` is destroyed (`mem::free`) when the `ScopeRegion` is destroyed or recycled. It is *not* transferred during `scope_splice_escapes`.

**3. The Consistency Invariant for Aborted Promotions (Tri-State)**
If `copy_to_lane` exceeds the latency budget and aborts, we are left with a partially promoted graph.
* **The Invariant:** A partially promoted graph is **valid and safe**, but the scope is now flagged `Unsplittable`.
* **The Fallback:** When an `Unsplittable` scope finishes, the runtime executes the traditional $O(N)$ `copy_to_parent` on the *entire* return root. 
* **No-Duplication Guarantee:** The fallback `copy_to_parent` **must** participate in the same Epoch Memoization system! When it walks the graph, any nodes that were previously promoted will have their `scope_gen == ESCAPE_GENERATION`. The fallback walker treats these as already-safe leaves and does *not* recopy them. This prevents duplicating the partially-promoted nodes.
* **Shared Promotion Context:** `copy_to_lane` and fallback `copy_to_parent` must share one promotion context per return boundary (same epoch namespace + memo table instance) so partial work is reused deterministically.

**4. RC > 1 Behavior under Unsplittable**
If a scope is flagged `Unsplittable` (meaning it contains tangled temp/escape pointers) AND its `RC > 1` (a closure captured it):
* **The Behavior:** The runtime does *nothing*. 
* **Why:** The fundamental rule of Region-RC is that captured scopes survive intact. Because the scope is surviving, the `TEMP` lane is surviving. Therefore, any pointers from `ESCAPE` to `TEMP` are perfectly safe. The "Unsplittable" flag simply means we cannot optimize the return by tearing the scope in half. Both lanes live on as a floating heap island for the closure.

**5. FFI / Raw Pointer Policy (Explicit Exclusion Zone)**
Raw/native pointers (FFI-managed memory or opaque external handles) are outside lane provenance unless wrapped in runtime-managed `Value` carriers with explicit ownership metadata.
* Barrier logic must not assume transitive safety through opaque native pointers.
* Any native write path that can embed runtime pointers must route through explicit bridge functions that apply the same lane checks/promotion rules.
* If ownership/provenance cannot be proven, treat as boundary-unsafe and force conservative promotion at the bridge boundary.

*Overall Plan Confidence:* **0.92**. The theoretical models (Cyclone/RC) are now fully grounded in strict memory ownership semantics, deterministic fallback states, and explicit coverage rules appropriate for the Omni runtime.


---

## 19. Revision XII (Final Pre-Implementation Clarifications)

### Antithesis XII: The Devil in the Micro-Details
While Section 18 formalizes the macro-architecture, three micro-level ambiguities remain that could cause performance degradation or correctness bugs during C3 implementation:
1. The $O(1)$ fast-path for checking if an address `A` is in the `ESCAPE` lane is undefined.
2. The exact handoff of the memoization epoch between an aborted `copy_to_lane` and the fallback `copy_to_parent` is implicit.
3. FFI and native raw pointers represent a potential blind spot in the "All-Pointer-Write" rule.

### Synthesis XII: The Micro-Specification
These final clarifications lock down the physical C3 implementation constraints.

**1. The $O(1)$ Address Lane Check**
Determining if memory address `A` resides in the `ESCAPE` lane must never involve a linear scan of the `escape_chunks` linked list.
* **The Implementation:** `Value` and `Env` structs must embed their lane designation directly in their metadata stamp. We already have `scope_gen` (which differentiates `TEMP_GENERATION` from `ESCAPE_GENERATION`).
* **The Fast Path:** `is_escape_lane(A)` is simply `((Value*)A)->scope_gen == scope->escape_generation`. This is a single memory load and integer comparison (1-2 CPU instructions).

**2. Epoch Handoff on Abort**
If a promotion aborts (Tri-State Fallback), the subsequent `copy_to_parent` executed at scope exit **must not** increment the promotion epoch.
* **The Rule:** The fallback `copy_to_parent` must be explicitly passed the *same* `promotion_epoch` that was active when the scope was flagged `Unsplittable`. This guarantees that nodes partially promoted during the aborted run are recognized as safely visited during the fallback walk.

**3. The FFI / Raw Pointer Exemption**
The "All-Pointer-Write" rule applies strictly to Lisp-managed heap pointers (`Value*`, `Env*`). 
* **Native Pointers:** Raw C pointers (`void*`), FFI handles, and unmanaged native structs are opaque to the Omni region system. They do not trigger the write barrier, nor are they followed during promotion traversal. Their lifecycle is explicitly managed by the FFI boundary rules, not the bump allocator's lane routing.

*Final Readiness Confidence:* **0.90**. The design is structurally sound, mathematically bounded, and fully mapped to concrete C3 mechanics. Proceed to Commit 1.

---

## 20. Revision XIII (Clean Consolidated Systems Spec)

### Scope
This section consolidates Sections 1-19 into one implementation-ready specification.
Where conflicts exist, this section is authoritative.

### Consolidated Specification

**1. Core Architecture (Dual-Bump, Single-Scope)**
* Each `ScopeRegion` owns two allocation lanes: `TEMP` and `ESCAPE`.
* No stop-the-world GC is introduced; lifecycle remains RC + scope/region based.
* `scope_adopt` is not used in normal return flow and is removed once parity gates pass.

**2. Allocation Policy (Intent-Based, Not Tail-Guessing)**
* Allocation lane is selected by ownership intent, not by AST tail-position heuristics.
* `TEMP` is the default for local/transient work.
* `ESCAPE` is used for values that are expected to cross the boundary (return builders, captured env payloads, root-bound inserts).
* This keeps temporary churn cheap while minimizing promotion volume.

**3. Write-Barrier Invariant (Hard Rule)**
* A `TEMP` pointer must never be embedded inside an `ESCAPE` container.
* Every pointer-write mutator path (`make_cons`, `set-car!`, `set-cdr!`, array/hashmap/env writes, and bridge mutators) enforces this rule.
* Lane check must be O(1) using stamped provenance (`scope_gen`/lane metadata), never via chunk-list scans on hot writes.
* If a violating write is attempted, run targeted promotion (`copy_to_lane`) before commit.

**4. Fallback Semantics (Tri-State, Epoch-Reusing)**
* `copy_to_lane` runs under a bounded budget (for example, 4KB traversal budget).
* On budget abort: mark scope `Unsplittable` and record a deferred-boundary state.
* `copy_to_lane` and fallback `copy_to_parent` share the same promotion context (epoch namespace + memo table) so partial promotion work is reused without duplication.
* Unsplittable exit behavior:
  * `RC == 1`: perform fallback boundary promotion on the returned graph at scope exit.
  * `RC > 1`: do not split; both lanes survive as a captured island (correct by RC lifetime).

**5. Scope Exit Fast Path (O(1) Splice)**
* If scope is splittable and `RC == 1`: splice `ESCAPE` chunks into parent in O(1), run/free `TEMP` lane resources.
* If scope is splittable and `RC > 1`: keep both lanes attached to the captured scope.
* No mandatory graph walk is allowed on the hot return path once the one-way invariant has been maintained during writes.

### Readiness
This is a coherent production baseline: deterministic lifetimes, no stop-the-world pauses, O(1) return transfer on the common path, and bounded fallback on dynamic boundary-heavy graphs.

**Confidence Score:** **0.92**.

---

## 21. Revision XIV (Implementation Closure and Runtime Status)

### Scope
This section records what is implemented in the runtime as of 2026-03-03 and
acts as the operational truth for engineering work.

### Implemented Status

**1. Dual-Lane Core Is Live**
* `ScopeRegion` uses split TEMP/ESCAPE allocation and splice-based return handoff.
* Normal return flow uses lane promotion + O(1) ESCAPE splice; the old
  `scope_adopt` path is retired from runtime flow.
* The runtime remains deterministic (RC/scope lifetime), with no stop-the-world GC.

**2. Boundary Promotion Context Is Shared**
* Promotion/copy operations run with a shared boundary context (epoch + memo)
  so partial work is reused instead of duplicated.
* Budgeted abort is enforced on boundary promotion paths; fallback copy runs in
  the same epoch context for deterministic reuse semantics.

**3. Root-Boundary Safety Is Explicit**
* Root promotion uses a dedicated boundary helper that preserves defensive-copy
  semantics for disjoint transient lifetimes.
* This prevents accidental unsafe reuse when a value is outside both releasing
  scope and surviving target chain.

**4. `copy_env_to_scope` Hot Churn Reduced**
* Env-copy now reuses one promotion context across recursive copy.
* Shared captured values are memoized at boundary copy sites.
* Existing target-chain values are reused directly instead of deep-copied.
* Closure/iterator deep-copy paths are gated by scope-chain membership.

**5. Telemetry Is Tightened**
* Dead copy-site buckets were removed and active copy-site IDs compacted.
* Copy-site counting uses `COPY_SITE_COUNT` bounds, and site storage matches
  the active count.

### Guardrails Implemented (Must Stay Green)
Memory lifetime regression suite includes explicit gates for:
* `lifetime: root-boundary promotion defends disjoint scope`
* `lifetime: cons-barrier fallback sites stay at zero`
* `lifetime: copy_env shared-value memo gate`
* `lifetime: jit/copy hot-site budget gate`
* `lifetime: tco frame-copy budget gate`
* `lifetime: promotion context memo gate`
* `lifetime: promotion abort fallback gate`

### Validation Baseline
Current verified baseline (2026-03-03):
* Unified tests: `1051 passed, 0 failed`
* Compiler tests: `73 passed, 0 failed`
* ASAN run: clean (`c3c build --sanitize=address` + runtime suite)

### Remaining Work Classification
No architecture-critical migration blockers remain for this plan revision.
Future work is optimization/tuning only (for example longer soak/benchmark runs),
not correctness migration.

**Operational Confidence:** **0.95**.

## 22. Revision XV (Fiber-Temp Completion Marker and Architecture Freeze)

### Scope
This section records the closure state as of 2026-03-05 for the fiber-temp and
boundary-hardening execution track.

### Closure Status

The project phase is complete for the intended architecture target:
* Region/boundary ownership remains authoritative (`TEMP`/`ESCAPE` +
  retain/release boundary policy).
* Fiber TEMP is implemented as an optional backing strategy for eligible TEMP
  allocations, guarded by `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP`.
* Stack teardown semantics are generic/defer-based and clone-safe.
* Scheduler/offload boundary regressions for wakeup ordering, payload ownership,
  cancellation, timeout, and interleaving are covered and green.

### Explicit Non-Goal (By Design)

Fiber TEMP is not a new ownership authority and is not intended to replace the
region model. Eligibility and bypass gates are expected behavior:
* `eligible_slow_allocs`
* `bypass_large_allocs`
* `bypass_escape_activity_allocs`

These counters indicate safe routing decisions, not incomplete migration.

### Validation Snapshot (2026-03-05)

* Normal full suite: `Unified 1212 passed, 0 failed`; `Compiler 73 passed, 0 failed`
* ASAN full suite: `Unified 1211 passed, 0 failed`; `Compiler 73 passed, 0 failed`
* ASAN + `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP=1` repeated soak: clean across repeated runs

### Operational Posture

No correctness blockers remain for this phase. Remaining work is optional:
test decomposition, CI ergonomics, and incremental perf tuning under existing
ownership guardrails.
