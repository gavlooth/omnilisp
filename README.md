# OmniLisp

**OmniLisp** is a high-performance, multi-paradigm Lisp dialect designed for systems programming and modern application development. It combines the minimalism of **Scheme**, the industrial power of **Common Lisp**, the modern type system of **Julia**, and the data-driven elegance of **Clojure**, all built on a foundation of **CTRR (Compile-Time Region Reclamation)**.

## Key Design Pillars

*   **CTRR Memory Model:** Deterministic region-based reclamation scheduled at compile time (no stop-the-world GC).
*   **Two-Tier Concurrency:** High-performance OS threads (pthreads) combined with lightweight green threads (delimited continuations).
*   **Multiple Dispatch:** Full multiple dispatch on all arguments (Julia-style).
*   **Algebraic Effects:** Resumable exception handling and structured control flow.
*   **Hygienic Macros:** True syntax transformers with pattern matching and hygiene.
*   **Modern Syntax:** S-expressions with specialized brackets (`[]` for arrays/bindings, `{}` for types/FFI, `#{}` for dicts).

## Current Status (2026-01-07)

The project features a unified C99 + POSIX toolchain (parser, analysis, codegen) and runtime implementing:

### Memory Management (CTRR)
| Optimization | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Region Lifetime Scheduling** | ✅ | Compiler schedules `region_create` / `region_exit` at scope boundaries. |
| **Transmigration on Escape** | ✅ | Explicit escape repair: copy/move graphs between regions. |
| **Thread-Safe Tethering** | ✅ | Borrow-window pinning to prevent region reclamation during calls. |
| **Metadata-Driven Transmigration** | 🚧 | Required by the CTRR contract; spec is written, implementation is pending. |

### Language Features
*   **Special Forms:** `define`, `lambda`/`fn`, `let`, `if`, `do`/`begin`, `match`, `handle`/`perform`.
*   **Data Types:** Integers, Floats, Symbols, Lists, Arrays, Dicts, Strings, Characters.
*   **Concurrency:** Delimited continuations (`prompt`/`control`), Fibers (ucontext), CSP Channels.
*   **Modules:** Full module system with `export`, `import`, and namespace aliasing.
*   **FFI:** Handle-based Foreign Function Interface with ownership annotations.

## Memory Management: CTRR is NOT Garbage Collection

OmniLisp uses **CTRR (Compile-Time Region Reclamation)**: the compiler schedules
region lifetimes and inserts explicit runtime operations for **escapes**
(transmigration) and **borrows** (tethering). There is **no stop-the-world
tracing collector**.

Canonical references:

- `docs/CTRR.md` (short, normative contract)
- `runtime/docs/CTRR_TRANSMIGRATION.md` (detailed transmigration contract)

## Concurrency & Effects

OmniLisp provides structured control flow through **Delimited Continuations** and **Algebraic Effects**.

```lisp
;; Define an effect
(define {effect ask} :one-shot (returns String))

;; Handle the effect
(handle
  (str "Hello, " (perform ask))
  (ask (_ resume) (resume "World")))  ; -> "Hello, World"
```

The concurrency model is two-tiered:
- **Tier 1:** OS Threads for true parallelism and blocking I/O.
- **Tier 2:** Lightweight green threads (Fibers) for massive concurrency using CSP channels.

## Syntax Showcase

```lisp
;; Vector bindings and dot notation
(let [person #{:name "Alice" :age 30}]
  (println person.name))

;; Multiple dispatch method
(define [method area Circle] [c]
  (* π c.radius c.radius))

;; Hygienic macros
(define [syntax unless]
  [(unless test body ...)
   (if test nothing (do body ...))])

;; FFI with ownership annotations
(define {extern malloc :from libc}
  [size {CSize}]
  -> {^:owned CPtr})
```
