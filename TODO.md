# OmniLisp TODO (Active Tasks)

This file contains only active tasks: `[TODO]`, `[IN_PROGRESS]`, and `[BLOCKED]`.

**Completed tasks:** See `TODO_COMPLETED.md`

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-15

## Review Directive

**All newly implemented features must be marked with `[DONE] (Review Needed)` until explicitly approved by the user.**
- When an agent completes implementing a feature, mark it `[DONE] (Review Needed)` (not `[DONE]`)
- If a feature is blocked, mark it `[BLOCKED]` with a reason
- `[DONE] (Review Needed)` means: code is written and working, but awaits user review/approval
- After user approval, move completed tasks to `TODO_COMPLETED.md`
- Workflow: `[TODO]` → implement → `[DONE] (Review Needed)` → user approves → move to archive

## Global Directives (Read First)

### Repo Root + Path Discipline

**Do not assume an absolute clone path.** All paths are **repo-relative**.

When writing or running verification commands:
- Prefer: `REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` then use `"$REPO_ROOT/..."`
- Prefer `rg -n "pattern" path/` over `ls ... | grep ...`
- Prefer `find path -name 'pattern'` over `ls | grep` for existence checks

### Transmigration Directive (Non-Negotiable)

**Correctness invariant:** For every in-region heap object `src` reached during transmigration, `remap(src)` yields exactly one stable destination `dst`, and all pointer discovery/rewrites happen only via metadata-driven `clone/trace`.

**Do not bypass the metadata-driven transmigration machinery for "fast paths".**

### Issue Authoring Directive

- **Append-only numbering:** Never renumber existing issues
- **No duplicates:** One header per issue number
- **Status required:** Every task line must be `[TODO]`, `[IN_PROGRESS]`, `[DONE] (Review Needed)`, `[BLOCKED]`, or `[N/A]`

### Jujutsu Commit Directive

**Use Jujutsu (jj) for ALL version control operations.**

Before beginning ANY implementation subtask:
1. Run `jj describe -m "Issue N: task description"`
2. Run `jj log` to see current state
3. If mismatch: Either `jj squash` to consolidate or `jj new` to start fresh

## Design Decisions

### Data Structure Simplification (2026-01-15)

**Decision:** OmniLisp uses exactly **3 core collection types**:

| Type | Syntax | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **List** | `(1 2 3)` | Cons cells, code representation, recursive processing |
| **Array** | `[1 2 3]` | Mutable, indexed access, general sequences |
| **Dict** | `#{:a 1 :b 2}` | Key-value storage, structured data |

**Deprecated types** (runtime support retained for backward compatibility):
- **Tuple** → Use arrays instead (same semantics, simpler model)
- **Named Tuple** → Use dicts instead (`:key value` pairs)
- **Alist/Plist** → Use dicts instead (unified key-value abstraction)

**Rationale:**
1. Tuples provide no semantic benefit over arrays in a Region-RC model
2. Named tuples are just dicts with ordered iteration (dicts suffice)
3. Alists/Plists are legacy Lisp patterns; dicts are more intuitive
4. Fewer types = simpler mental model, consistent destructuring syntax
5. No immutability notation needed: Region-RC handles mutation safety at region boundaries

**Documentation updated:**
- `docs/SYNTAX.md` - Collection syntax
- `language_reference.md` - Destructuring patterns, type examples
- `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Let destructuring
- `docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md` - Character Calculus table, variance examples
- `docs/LANGUAGE_COMPLETENESS_REPORT.md` - Data types status

**Runtime deprecation:**
- `mk_tuple()`, `mk_tuple_region()` - marked deprecated
- `mk_named_tuple()`, `mk_named_tuple_region()` - marked deprecated
- `print_tuple()`, `print_named_tuple()` - marked deprecated

## Issue 9: Feature Completion: Algebraic Effects, Continuations, and Typed Arrays [TODO]

**Objective:** Implement missing core functionality in the Algebraic Effect system, Fiber/Continuation system, and Typed Arrays.

**IMPORTANT Design Decision (2026-01-14):**
- `try`/`catch` is **NOT supported** in OmniLisp
- Error handling uses **algebraic effects** instead (see `SYNTAX_REVISION.md` Section 7)
- Algebraic effects are implemented using **delimited continuations** (shift/reset style)
- `handle` installs a prompt; effect operations capture continuation to handler
- Handlers can resume, discard, or invoke multiple times the captured continuation

**Reference (read first):**
- `docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md` (Section 7: Algebraic Effects)
- `DISCONNECTED_EDGES_ANALYSIS.md` (Sections 2, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4)
- `runtime/src/effect.c`
- `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c`

**Constraints:**
- `try`/`catch` syntax is explicitly NOT supported
- Must satisfy existing test stubs in `runtime/tests`

### P0: Effect Tracing & Fiber Callbacks [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I9-t4-effect-tracing

## Issue 12: Parser Syntax Completion [N/A - Duplicate of Issue 6]

**Status:** N/A - This is a duplicate of Issue 6. All work tracked under Issue 6.

---

## Issue 14: Continuation Infrastructure Integration [TODO]

**Objective:** Wire the existing continuation/effect infrastructure into the compiler and runtime.

**DESIGN PRINCIPLE:** Continuations are the **foundational primitive**. Everything else
(effects, generators, async, trampolines) builds on top of continuations. The correct
integration order is: continuations → regions → trampolines → effects → higher abstractions.

**Analysis (2026-01-14):** The runtime has comprehensive infrastructure that is NOT connected:
- CEK machine with continuation frames exists but codegen doesn't use it
- Effect system exists but no primitives are registered
- Region system doesn't connect to continuation prompts as designed
- Duplicate systems: conditions/restarts vs effects, trampoline vs CEK

**Reference (read first):**
- `runtime/src/memory/continuation.h` (CEK machine, fibers, generators, promises)
- `runtime/src/effect.h` (effect handlers, resumptions)
- `docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md` (Section 7: Algebraic Effects)
- `docs/CTRR.md` (Region memory model)

### P0: Region-Continuation Boundary Integration [DONE] (Review Needed) (FOUNDATION)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I14-p0-prompt-region-boundary
  Objective: Connect continuation prompts with region boundaries.
  Where: `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c`, `runtime/src/memory/continuation.h`
  What was done (already implemented in codebase):
    1. `Region* region` field exists in Prompt frame (continuation.h:99)
    2. `cont_prompt()` creates child region on prompt install (continuation.c:487)
    3. `cont_capture()` transmigrates frame contents to parent (continuation.c:363-374)
    4. `cont_prompt_exit()` calls `region_exit()` on prompt's region (continuation.c:574)
    5. `frame_transmigrate_contents()` handles all frame types (continuation.c:248-301)
  Verification:
    - Region-Continuation boundary is fully integrated
    - Continuation system uses CTRR for memory safety

### P1: Trampoline-CEK Unification [TODO] (USE FOUNDATION)

- [TODO] Label: I14-p1-trampoline-use-cek
  Objective: Reimplement trampoline using CEK machine.
  Where: `runtime/src/trampoline.c`
  Why: Trampoline is manual continuation-passing. CEK provides this natively.
       Once regions are connected, CEK frames have proper lifetime management.
  What to change:
    1. Replace bounce objects with CEK APP frames
    2. Use `omni_cek_step` instead of manual trampoline loop
    3. Bounce thunks become proper continuation frames
    4. Remove manual mark-field hack for function pointers
  Verification: Mutual recursion tests pass with CEK backend.

### P2: Wire Effect Primitives [DONE] (Review Needed) (BUILD ON CONTINUATIONS)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I14-p2-register-effect-primitives
  Objective: Register effect primitives for use from Lisp code.
  Where: `runtime/src/runtime.c`, `runtime/src/effect.c`
  What was done:
    1. `prim_perform` - performs effect by name, captures continuation
    2. `prim_resume` - resumes captured continuation with value
    3. `effect_handle` - runs body thunk with handlers installed
    4. Primitives already registered in runtime
  Verification: ✓ All 7 effect tests pass (see tests/test_effects.lisp)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I14-p2-codegen-handle-form
  Objective: Emit C code for `handle` special form.
  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c`
  What was done:
    1. Added `handle` to special form detection
    2. Added `codegen_handler_closure` - generates static handler functions with region-aware signature
    3. Added `codegen_body_thunk` - generates 0-arg closure for handle body
    4. Emit `effect_handle(_body_thunk, _h_clauses, _h_return_clause, NULL)`
    5. Handler closures receive (payload, resume) args and can call `prim_resume`
  IMPORTANT: Built-in `Fail` effect is RECOVERY_ABORT mode (can't resume).
             Use custom effect names for resumable effects.
  Verification: ✓ Generated C compiles and runs, 7 tests pass:
    - Test 1: No effect (body returns 3)
    - Test 2: Perform+resume (1+42=43)
    - Test 5: Chained ops (5+10=15)
    - Test 6: Payload use (5*2=10)
    - Test 7: Nested expr (2*(3+5)=16)

### P3: Unify Condition/Restart with Effects [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I14-p3-unify-conditions-effects
  Objective: Reimplement conditions/restarts on top of effect system.
  Where: `runtime/src/condition.c`, `runtime/src/restart.c`
  Why: Currently duplicate error handling systems. Effects subsume conditions.
  What to change:
    1. Define `{effect Condition}` with raise/handle operations
    2. Rewrite condition_signal using omni_effect_perform
    3. Rewrite restarts as effect handlers with resume
  Verification: Existing condition tests pass using effect backend.

### P4: Iterator-Generator Integration [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I14-p4-iterator-generator
  Objective: Implement iterators using generator continuations.
  Where: `runtime/src/iterator.c`
  Why: Generators provide proper lazy evaluation with suspend/resume.
       Generators are implemented using delimited continuations.
  What to change:
    1. Implement `prim_iterate` using `omni_generator_create`
    2. Implement `prim_iter_next` using `omni_generator_next`
    3. Add `yield` primitive using generator yield
  Verification: `(take 5 (iterate inc 0))` returns `[0 1 2 3 4]`.

### P4: Iterator-Generator Integration [TODO]

  Why: Required to enforce Region Closure Property at mutation time.
  What to change:
    1. Create `omni_store_barrier(Obj* container, int field, Obj* value)` function
    2. Implement lifetime check: `if (!omni_region_outlives(dst_region, src_region))`
    3. Auto-repair via transmigrate or merge based on `get_merge_threshold()`
    4. Update codegen to emit store barrier for all pointer field assignments
    5. Increment `region->escape_repair_count` on auto-repair

    - Younger→older store triggers auto-repair
    - `runtime/tests/test_store_barrier.c` passes

### P3: region_of(obj) Lookup [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I15-p3-region-of-lookup
  Objective: Implement O(1) lookup from object pointer to owning region.
  Where: `runtime/src/memory/region_pointer.h`, `runtime/src/memory/region_core.c`
  Why: Store barrier needs to determine object's region efficiently.
  What to change:
    1. Option A: Use existing pointer masking (region_id in high bits)
       - Add `region_lookup_by_id(uint16_t id)` global registry
    2. Option B: Store region pointer in object header (space tradeoff)
    3. Implement `Region* region_of(Obj* obj)` using chosen strategy
  Verification:
    - `region_of(arena_allocated_obj)` returns correct region
    - O(1) lookup performance

- [TODO] Label: I15-p4-size-class-segregation
  Objective: Separate arenas for different allocation sizes.
  Where: `runtime/src/memory/region_core.h`
  Why: Better cache locality for homogeneous object traversal.
  What to change:
    1. Add `Arena pair_arena` for TYPE_ID_PAIR allocations
    2. Add `Arena container_arena` for arrays/dicts/strings
    3. Route `region_alloc_typed()` to appropriate arena
  Note: May not be needed - inline buffer already handles small objects.

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I16-p3-lambda-closure-wrapper
  Objective: Generate closure wrappers for inline lambdas in HOF calls.
  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c`
  What was done:
    1. Added `is_lambda_expr()` to detect lambda forms (lambda, fn, λ)
    2. Added `count_lambda_params()` to count parameters
    3. Added `codegen_lambda_as_closure()` that generates:
       - Static lambda function (`_lambda_N`)
       - Trampoline function (`_lambda_N_tramp`) adapting signature to `ClosureFnRegion`
       - `mk_closure_region()` call to wrap trampoline
    4. HOF handlers now detect inline lambdas and use closure wrapper
    5. Removed arrow syntax (`->`) - superseded by `(fn [params] body)`
  Verification: `(map (fn [x] (* x 2)) '(1 2 3))` → `(2 4 6)` ✓

### P4: Generic Method Region Support [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I16-p4-generic-method-region
  Objective: Add region-aware method support to generic functions.
  Where: `runtime/src/generic.c`
  What was done:
    1. Updated `MethodInfo` struct with `impl_region` union + `region_aware` flag
    2. Added `generic_add_method_region()` for region-aware methods
    3. Added `call_generic_region()` / `omni_generic_invoke_region()`

### P5: prim_deep_put Store Barriers [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I16-p5-deep-put-barriers
  Objective: Implement deep_set with store barriers for nested mutations.
  Where: `runtime/src/runtime.c`
  What was done:
    1. Implemented `deep_set()` with `omni_store_repair()` for all mutations
    2. Supports alist-style structures: `((key1 . val1) (key2 . val2) ...)`
    3. Recursive path traversal with barrier at each level

## Issue 17: Remaining Integration Tasks [DONE] (Review Needed)

**Objective:** Complete integration of Region-RC with continuation, effect, and codegen systems.

**Reference (read first):**
- Issue 14 (Continuation Infrastructure)
- Issue 9 (Algebraic Effects)
- `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c`
- `runtime/src/effect.c`

### P0: Array Growth with Region Realloc [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I17-p0-array-growth
  Objective: Implement proper array growth that preserves region membership.
  Where: `runtime/src/runtime.c:852-884`
  What was done:
    1. Implemented `array_grow()` function that allocates new data buffer in same region
    2. Updated `array_push()` to grow array when full (2x capacity, minimum 8)
    3. Elements copied directly (no barrier needed, already safe)
    4. Old data becomes garbage, reclaimed with region
  Verification: ✓ Test confirms array grows from 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 with 20 pushes

### P1: Store Barrier Merge Path [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I17-p1-store-barrier-merge
  Objective: Add merge path to store barrier (currently only transmigrates).
  Where: `runtime/src/runtime.c:979-1006`
  What was done: (Already implemented in prior work)
    1. `omni_store_repair()` checks `get_merge_threshold()` for large regions
    2. Calls `region_merge_safe()` for regions above threshold
    3. Falls back to transmigrate for smaller regions or merge failure
  Verification: ✓ Tests "store barrier checks merge threshold" and "merge safe basic" pass

### P2: Print Functions Completion [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I17-p2-print-completion
  Objective: Complete print functions for container types.
  Where: `runtime/src/runtime.c:1247-1330`
  What was done:
    1. Implemented `print_array()` - iterates and prints `[elem1 elem2 ...]`
    2. Implemented `print_tuple()` - iterates and prints `{elem1 elem2 ...}`
    3. Implemented `print_dict()` - iterates buckets and prints `#{:key val ...}`
    4. Implemented `print_named_tuple()` - prints `#(:key val ...)`
    5. Fixed `alloc_obj_region()` to preserve original tag for unmapped types (TAG_KEYWORD)
  Verification: ✓ `[1 2 3]`, `{10 20 30}`, `#{:a 100}`, `#(:x 5)` all print correctly
