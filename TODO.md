    - [ ] Remove `spawn_goroutine()` (use fibers instead)
    - [ ] Add OmniLisp primitives: `thread`, `thread-join`, `thread-id`
    - [ ] Keep `atomic`, `mutex` for OS-level sync
  How to verify: OS thread primitives work independently of fibers.

  How to verify: `runtime/tests/test_threadpool` - all tests pass with steals.
  Acceptance:
    - Fibers can run on any worker thread
    - Work-stealing for load balancing (1000 steals in test)
