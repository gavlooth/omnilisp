# OmniLisp TODO (Active Tasks)

This file contains only active tasks: `[TODO]`, `[IN_PROGRESS]`, and `[BLOCKED]`.

**Completed tasks:** See `TODO_COMPLETED.md`

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-14

## Review Directive

**All newly implemented features must be marked with `[DONE] (Review Needed)` until explicitly approved by the user.**
- When an agent completes implementing a feature, mark it `[DONE] (Review Needed)` (not `[DONE]`)
- If a feature is blocked, mark it `[BLOCKED]` with a reason
- `[DONE] (Review Needed)` means: code is written and working, but awaits user review/approval
- After user approval, move completed tasks to `TODO_COMPLETED.md`
- Workflow: `[TODO]` → implement → `[DONE] (Review Needed)` → user approves → move to archive

## Global Directives (Read First)

### Repo Root + Path Discipline

**Do not assume an absolute clone path.** All paths are **repo-relative**.

When writing or running verification commands:
- Prefer: `REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` then use `"$REPO_ROOT/..."`
- Prefer `rg -n "pattern" path/` over `ls ... | grep ...`
- Prefer `find path -name 'pattern'` over `ls | grep` for existence checks

### Transmigration Directive (Non-Negotiable)

**Correctness invariant:** For every in-region heap object `src` reached during transmigration, `remap(src)` yields exactly one stable destination `dst`, and all pointer discovery/rewrites happen only via metadata-driven `clone/trace`.

**Do not bypass the metadata-driven transmigration machinery for "fast paths".**

### Issue Authoring Directive

- **Append-only numbering:** Never renumber existing issues
- **No duplicates:** One header per issue number
- **Status required:** Every task line must be `[TODO]`, `[IN_PROGRESS]`, `[DONE] (Review Needed)`, `[BLOCKED]`, or `[N/A]`

### Jujutsu Commit Directive

**Use Jujutsu (jj) for ALL version control operations.**

Before beginning ANY implementation subtask:
1. Run `jj describe -m "Issue N: task description"`
2. Run `jj log` to see current state
3. If mismatch: Either `jj squash` to consolidate or `jj new` to start fresh

## Issue 9: Feature Completion: Algebraic Effects, Continuations, and Typed Arrays [TODO]

**Objective:** Implement missing core functionality in the Algebraic Effect system, Fiber/Continuation system, and Typed Arrays.

**IMPORTANT Design Decision (2026-01-14):**
- `try`/`catch` is **NOT supported** in OmniLisp
- Error handling uses **algebraic effects** instead (see `SYNTAX_REVISION.md` Section 7)
- Algebraic effects are implemented using **delimited continuations** (shift/reset style)
- `handle` installs a prompt; effect operations capture continuation to handler
- Handlers can resume, discard, or invoke multiple times the captured continuation

**Reference (read first):**
- `docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md` (Section 7: Algebraic Effects)
- `DISCONNECTED_EDGES_ANALYSIS.md` (Sections 2, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4)
- `runtime/src/effect.c`
- `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c`

**Constraints:**
- `try`/`catch` syntax is explicitly NOT supported
- Must satisfy existing test stubs in `runtime/tests`

### P0: Effect Tracing & Fiber Callbacks [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I9-t4-effect-tracing

  Verification: New test `runtime/tests/test_effect_tracing.c` passes.

- [TODO] Label: I9-t5-continuation-repair
  Objective: Complete fiber callback execution (on_fulfill, on_reject) and error handling.
  Where: `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c`
  Why: 6 TODOs indicate incomplete async/coroutine functionality.

### P1: Typed Array Functional Primitives [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I9-t6-typed-array-primitives
  Objective: Implement map, filter, and reduce for typed arrays.
  Where: `runtime/src/typed_array.c`

  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c`, `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c`
  What to change:
    1. Add `handle` to special form detection
    2. Generate code that installs continuation prompt via runtime

  Where: `runtime/include/omni_debug.h`
  What to change:
    1. Create debug toggle macros

## Issue 12: Parser Syntax Completion [N/A - Duplicate of Issue 6]

**Status:** N/A - This is a duplicate of Issue 6. All work tracked under Issue 6.

---

## Issue 14: Continuation Infrastructure Integration [TODO]

**Objective:** Wire the existing continuation/effect infrastructure into the compiler and runtime.

**Analysis (2026-01-14):** The runtime has comprehensive infrastructure that is NOT connected:
- CEK machine with continuation frames exists but codegen doesn't use it
- Effect system exists but no primitives are registered
- Region system doesn't connect to continuation prompts as designed
- Duplicate systems: conditions/restarts vs effects, trampoline vs CEK

**Reference (read first):**
- `runtime/src/memory/continuation.h` (CEK machine, fibers, generators, promises)
- `runtime/src/effect.h` (effect handlers, resumptions)
- `docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md` (Section 7: Algebraic Effects)

### P0: Wire Effect Primitives [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I14-p0-register-effect-primitives
  Objective: Register effect primitives for use from Lisp code.
  Where: `runtime/src/primitives.c` or new `runtime/src/primitives_effect.c`
  What to change:
    1. Create `prim_handle` - install effect handler
    2. Create `prim_perform` - perform effect operation
    3. Create `prim_resume` - resume captured continuation
    4. Register with primitive table
  Verification: `(handle (raise "test") [raise [msg] "caught"])` works.

- [TODO] Label: I14-p0-codegen-handle-form
  Objective: Emit C code for `handle` special form.
  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c`
  What to change:
    1. Add `handle` to special form detection
    2. Emit calls to `omni_effect_push_handler`
    3. Emit handler clauses as C functions
    4. Emit `omni_effect_pop_handler` at scope exit
  Verification: Generated C compiles and runs effect handling.

### P1: Unify Condition/Restart with Effects [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I14-p1-unify-conditions-effects
  Objective: Reimplement conditions/restarts on top of effect system.
  Where: `runtime/src/condition.c`, `runtime/src/restart.c`
  Why: Currently duplicate error handling systems.
  What to change:
    1. Define `{effect Condition}` with raise/handle operations
    2. Rewrite condition_signal using omni_effect_perform
    3. Rewrite restarts as effect handlers with resume
  Verification: Existing condition tests pass using effect backend.

### P2: Region-Continuation Boundary Integration [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I14-p2-prompt-region-boundary
  Objective: Connect continuation prompts with region boundaries.

    1. Add `Region*` field to Prompt frame
    2. On prompt install: create child region
    3. On control capture: transmigrate captured values
    4. On prompt exit: exit region
  Verification: Captured continuations don't hold stale region pointers.

### P3: Trampoline-CEK Unification [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I14-p3-trampoline-use-cek
  Objective: Reimplement trampoline using CEK machine.
  Where: `runtime/src/trampoline.c`
  Why: Currently reimplements continuation-passing manually.
  What to change:
    1. Replace bounce objects with CEK frames
    2. Use CEK step function instead of manual loop
  Verification: Mutual recursion tests pass with CEK backend.

### P4: Iterator-Generator Integration [TODO]

- [TODO] Label: I14-p4-iterator-generator
  Objective: Implement iterators using generator continuations.
  Where: `runtime/src/iterator.c`
  Why: Generators provide proper lazy evaluation with suspend/resume.
  What to change:
    1. Implement `prim_iterate` using `omni_generator_create`
    2. Implement `prim_iter_next` using `omni_generator_next`
    3. Add `yield` primitive using generator yield
