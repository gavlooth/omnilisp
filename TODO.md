# OmniLisp TODO

## Review Directive

**All newly implemented features must be marked with `[R]` (Review Needed) until explicitly approved by the user.**

- When an agent completes implementing a feature, mark it `[R]` (not `[DONE]`)
- `[R]` means: code is written and working, but awaits user review/approval
- After user approval, change `[R]` to `[DONE]`
- Workflow: `[TODO]` → implement → `[R]` → user approves → `[DONE]`

---

## Jujutsu Commit Directive (MANDATORY)

**Use Jujutsu (jj) for ALL version control operations.**

### Pre-Task Checklist (MANDATORY)

**Before beginning ANY implementation subtask, you MUST:**

1. **Run `jj describe`** to see the current working state
2. **Read the description** to understand what changes are in progress
3. **Confirm alignment** with the task you're about to implement
4. **If mismatch**: Either `jj squash` to consolidate or `jj new` to start fresh

```bash
# ALWAYS run this first
jj describe

# Example output:
# "Add region metadata type structures
#
# Working on:
# - Define TypeMetadata struct
# - Modify Region to include type_table
# - Update Obj to use type_id"
#
# If this matches your task, proceed. If not, resolve mismatch first.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents working on stale/abandoned changes
- Ensures atomic, focused commits
- Makes `jj squash` meaningful (one semantic change per description)
- Enables clean history with descriptive commits

### Commit Workflow

- **Use jj (not git)**: All commits must be made using `jj` commands
- **Squash workflow**: Use `jj squash` to combine related changes before committing
- **Immutable history**: JJ's model ensures the state hash is always a true hash
- **For every completed task:**
  - Create a dedicated jujutsu squash with a clear, imperative message (e.g., `Add effect handler core`)
  - Use `jj squash` to consolidate related changes
  - Use `jj commit` with descriptive messages following conventional commit format
  - Mark task as `[R]` in TODO.md after committing

**Why Jujutsu:**
- Immutable, reproducible state hashes
- Better branchless workflow
- Automatic change tracking
- Safer operations with easy undo via `jj undo`

**Basic workflow:**
```bash
jj status                    # Check status
jj squash                    # Combine staged changes
jj commit -m "feat: Add X"   # Commit changes
jj undo                      # Undo if needed
```

  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_pointer.h
  What: Zero-cost pointer encoding using high 16 bits for region ID.
  Verification: **ACHIEVED zero-cost encoding!** Benchmark results (2025-01-08):
  - Encoding: ~0.00 ns/op (bitwise OR + shift)
  - Decoding: ~0.00 ns/op (bitwise AND)
  - Total: ~0.00 ns/op (essentially free)
  - Capacity: 65,536 regions × 32 TB each
  - All 9 test suites passed
  See: docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS_POINTER_MASKING.md

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-compiler
  Objective: Extend type checker to emit type_id constants.
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  What: Replace TAG constants with compile-time TypeID constants.
  How: Add type_id tracking to VarUsage struct, emit in codegen.

  Implementation (2026-01-08):
  - Created csrc/analysis/type_id.h with TypeID enum matching runtime
  - Created csrc/analysis/type_id.c with type name to TypeID mapping
  - Added type_id field to VarUsage struct (analysis.h:43)
  - Added omni_get_var_type_id() and omni_set_var_type_id() functions
  - Integrated type_id assignment in reuse analysis pass (analysis.c:1157-1178)
  - Variables now track compile-time type constants (TYPE_ID_INT, TYPE_ID_PAIR, etc.)

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-codegen
  Objective: Generate calls to alloc_obj_typed() in codegen.
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  What: Replace alloc_obj_region() calls with alloc_obj_typed().
  How: Use type_id from analysis instead of tag.

  Implementation (2026-01-08):
  - Added omni_codegen_emit_typed_alloc() to emit alloc_obj_typed() calls (codegen.h:178-181)
  - Added omni_codegen_get_var_type_id() to query type_id from analysis (codegen.h:189)
  - Updated let expression codegen to use typed allocation (codegen.c:3215-3243)
  - Falls back to region_alloc() for unknown types (TYPE_ID_GENERIC)
  - Type information flows: analysis → type_id → codegen

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-escape-alloc
  Objective: Implement escape-driven inline allocation.
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  What: Use escape analysis to determine inline allocation candidates.
  How: Check escape status and use inline threshold from metadata.

  Implementation (2026-01-08):
  - Added type_id_can_inline() to query inline capability (type_id.h:107)
  - Added type_id_inline_threshold() to get inline threshold (type_id.h:122)
  - Compile-time metadata tables mirror runtime TypeMetadata values
  - Enhanced codegen to document allocation strategy in comments (codegen.c:3230-3256)
  - Escape-driven allocation: non-escaping → stack, escaping → typed with inline

  Allocation Strategy:
  1. Non-escaping (ESCAPE_TARGET_NONE): Stack allocation
  2. Escaping + typed: alloc_obj_typed() with inline metadata
  3. Escaping + unknown: Generic region_alloc()

  Inline Allocation Types:
  - can_inline=true: INT, FLOAT, CHAR, PAIR, SYMBOL, BOX, ERROR, ATOM, TUPLE, NAMED_TUPLE, NOTHING
  - can_inline=false: ARRAY, STRING, DICT, CLOSURE, CHANNEL, THREAD, GENERIC, KIND
  - Thresholds: 8 bytes (CHAR/NOTHING) to 64 bytes (NAMED_TUPLE)

  Runtime Integration:
  - region_alloc_typed() automatically uses inline buffer based on metadata
  - Constructors (mk_int, mk_pair, etc.) use alloc_obj_typed()
  - Inline allocation happens transparently through existing code paths

## Phase 25: Wire Type Metadata to Compiler [ACTIVE]

**Objective:** Connect the Phase 24 type_id infrastructure to the actual compiler codegen so it generates `alloc_obj_typed()` calls directly.

**Why:** Currently the compiler generates calls to constructor functions (mk_int, mk_pair, etc.) which internally use alloc_obj_typed(). We want the compiler to emit `alloc_obj_typed()` directly to eliminate the indirection.

**Reference:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Clarified Terminology section)

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-compiler-type-inference-integration
  Objective: Integrate type_id assignment into type inference pass.
  Reference: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (current type inference)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  What: Assign type_id to variables during type inference, not just in reuse analysis.
  How:
    - Find where type inference assigns types to variables
    - Add type_id assignment alongside type assignment
    - Use type_name_to_type_id() to map inferred type to TypeID enum
    - Store in VarUsage->type_id field (already added)

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Locate type inference code:**
        - Search for where `alloc_type` or `reuse_candidate->type` is set
        - This is where type names are inferred (e.g., "Int", "Pair")
        - Currently only in reuse analysis pass

    *   **Add type_id assignment:**
        ```c
        // When type is inferred:
        const char* type_name = infer_type(expr);
        TypeID type_id = type_name_to_type_id(type_name);
        omni_set_var_type_id(ctx, var_name, type_id);
        ```

    *   **Cover more expression types:**
        - Currently only handles: cons, mk-int, mk-float
        - Need to add: array, string, symbol, dict, closure, etc.
        - See type_id.c for full mapping (19 types)

  Verification:
    - Test: Type inference assigns type_id correctly for all 19 core types
    - Test: Variables in let bindings have type_id set
    - Test: Unknown types default to TYPE_ID_GENERIC

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-compiler-codegen-direct-typed-alloc
  Objective: Generate alloc_obj_typed() calls instead of constructor functions.
  Reference: csrc/codegen/codegen.c (current code generation)
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  What: Replace mk_int(), mk_pair(), etc. with alloc_obj_typed() calls.
  How:
    - Find where codegen emits constructor calls
    - Replace with alloc_obj_typed() + field initialization
    - Use type_id from analysis (omni_get_var_type_id())
    - Emit type_id constant directly in generated code

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Find constructor generation sites:**
        - Search for `mk_int`, `mk_pair`, `prim_cons` in codegen.c
        - These are currently emitted as function calls

    *   **Generate direct allocation:**
        ```c
        // Instead of:
        Obj* x = mk_int(42);

        // Generate:
        Obj* x = alloc_obj_typed(_local_region, TYPE_ID_INT);
        x->tag = TAG_INT;
        x->int_val = 42;
        ```

    *   **Handle complex constructors:**
        - Pairs need allocation + car/cdr initialization
        - Arrays need size + element initialization
        - Closures need capture list initialization

  Verification:
    - Test: Generated code uses alloc_obj_typed() for integers
    - Test: Generated code uses alloc_obj_typed() for pairs
    - Test: Generated code compiles and runs correctly
    - Benchmark: Compare performance (should be same or slightly faster)

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-compiler-escape-driven-allocation
  Objective: Integrate escape analysis with inline allocation decisions.
  Reference: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (escape analysis), csrc/codegen/codegen.c (codegen)
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  What: Use escape status to choose between stack/inline/arena allocation.
  How:
    - Check escape status before generating allocation
    - Non-escaping: stack allocate (current behavior)
    - Escaping + typed: use alloc_obj_typed() (uses inline when appropriate)
    - Escaping + unknown: use region_alloc() (fallback)

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Current escape-driven allocation:**
        - Already in codegen.c:3210-3257
        - Non-escaping → stack allocation
        - Escaping → typed or arena allocation

    *   **Add inline allocation hints:**
        ```c
        if (escape == ESCAPE_TARGET_NONE) {
            // Stack allocate (already done)
        } else {
            int type_id = omni_get_var_type_id(ctx, var_name);
            if (type_id != TYPE_ID_GENERIC) {
                bool can_inline = type_id_can_inline(type_id);
                // Emit comment about inline capability
            }
            alloc_obj_typed(region, type_id);
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Test: Non-escaping variables use stack allocation
    - Test: Small escaping variables use inline buffer
    - Test: Large escaping variables use arena
    - Benchmark: Measure allocation speedup

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-compiler-type-coverage
  Objective: Ensure type_id coverage for all 19 core types.
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.c (type definitions)
  Where: csrc/analysis/type_id.c (type mapping)
  What: Add type_name_to_type_id() mappings for any missing types.
  How:
    - Check which of the 19 types are missing from type_id.c
    - Add mappings for: array, string, symbol, dict, closure, box, channel, thread, error, atom, tuple, named_tuple, generic, kind, nothing
    - Ensure all types have correct can_inline and inline_threshold values

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Audit current coverage:**
        - Currently: int, float, char, pair (4 types)
        - Missing: 15 types
        - See type_id.c:22-124 for current mappings

    *   **Add missing type mappings:**
        ```c
        if (strcmp(type_name, "Array") == 0) return TYPE_ID_ARRAY;
        if (strcmp(type_name, "String") == 0) return TYPE_ID_STRING;
        if (strcmp(type_name, "Symbol") == 0) return TYPE_ID_SYMBOL;
        // ... add 12 more types
        ```

    *   **Add constructor patterns:**
        - Search codegen for array/string/symbol constructors
        - Map each to appropriate TYPE_ID constant

  Verification:
    - Test: All 19 types have type_name_to_type_id() mapping
    - Test: Type inference works for all types
    - Test: Codegen generates correct type_id for all types

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-compiler-benchmark-typed-codegen
  Objective: Benchmark the direct typed allocation codegen.
  Reference: runtime/bench/BENCHMARK_RESULTS_METADATA.md
  Where: Create csrc/bench/bench_typed_codegen.c
  What: Measure performance of alloc_obj_typed() codegen vs constructor codegen.
  How:
    - Create test programs that allocate various types
    - Compare old codegen (constructors) vs new codegen (typed alloc)
    - Measure: allocation speed, code size, compilation time

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Create benchmark suite:**
        ```c
        // Test 1: Integer allocation
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            Obj* x = mk_int(i);  // Old way
        }

        // Test 2: Integer allocation (typed)
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            Obj* x = alloc_obj_typed(region, TYPE_ID_INT);  // New way
            x->tag = TAG_INT;
            x->int_val = i;
        }
        ```

    *   **Test all core types:**
        - Integers, floats, pairs, arrays, strings
        - Measure: time per operation, total time, memory usage

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Compare old vs new codegen performance
    - Benchmark: Measure inline buffer hit rate
    - Document: Create BENCHMARK_RESULTS_TYPED_CODEGEN.md
    - Target: Same or better performance than constructors

### Previous Optimizations (Completed)- [DONE] Label: T-opt-bitmap-cycle-detection

  Objective: Replace uthash with bitmap-based cycle detection in transmigrate.c.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED 2.7-12.5x speedup!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - Small list (1K): 131.19 ns/op → 48.46 ns/op (**2.7x faster**)
  - Medium list (100K): 353.10 ns/op → 74.88 ns/op (**4.7x faster**)
  - Tree (15 nodes): 512,573 ns/op → 51,114 ns/op (**10.0x faster**)
  - Wide structure (100): 8,529,571 ns/op → 681,771 ns/op (**12.5x faster**)

  Implementation: Replaced uthash hash table with bitmap-based cycle detection using Arena allocation.
  - Eliminated malloc() overhead for hash table nodes
  - O(1) bitmap operations instead of hash table lookups
  - Single arena_free() cleanup instead of hash iteration
  - See runtime/src/memory/transmigrate.c lines 15-87 for bitmap implementation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-splicing

  Objective: Implement O(1) region splicing for functional programming patterns.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED O(1) performance!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - Small result (1K): 55.27 ns/op (bitmap) → 38.91 ns/op (splicing) = **1.4x faster**
  - Large result (100K): 83.22 ns/op (bitmap) → 42.81 ns/op (splicing) = **1.9x faster**
  - **Critical insight:** Splicing shows O(1) performance - time per operation is constant regardless of size!

  Implementation: Added fast path in transmigrate() for result-only regions:
  - Detects when source has external_rc==0 and scope_alive==false (region is closing)
  - Transfers entire arena chunk with pointer manipulation (O(1))
  - No object-by-object copying needed
  - See runtime/src/memory/transmigrate.c lines 171-194 for splicing implementation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-pool

  Objective: Pool/reuse regions to reduce creation overhead.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED 6.9-21.1x speedup!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - Small regions (1000): 1,050.95 ns/op → 49.80 ns/op (**21.1x faster!**)
  - Mixed lifetimes (100): 10.90 ns/op (fastest case with optimal reuse)
  - **Critical insight:** Pooling eliminates malloc/free overhead for region lifecycle

  Implementation: Added thread-local region pool with 32-slot capacity:
  - Fast path in region_create(): reuse from pool (no malloc)
  - Fast path in region_destroy_if_dead(): return to pool (no free)
  - Automatic reset when returning to pool (arena_free + control block reset)
  - Pool size limit prevents unbounded memory growth
  - See runtime/src/memory/region_core.c lines 6-33, 35-42, 82-88 for pool implementation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-inline-allocation

  Objective: Inline allocate small objects (< 64 bytes) in region.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED 6.99x speedup over raw malloc!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - Small objects (1K): 2.12 ns/op (472M ops/sec)
  - Inline vs malloc: 0.023s vs 0.160s = **6.99x faster!**
  - Mixed sizes: 2.92 ns/op (343M ops/sec)
  - Buffer exhaustion: 3.01 ns/op (333M ops/sec)
  - Closure allocation: 2.88 ns/op (348M ops/sec)

  Implementation: Added 512-byte inline buffer to Region struct for fast small object allocation:
  - Fast path in region_alloc(): bump-pointer allocation for objects <= 64 bytes
  - Eliminates malloc() overhead for small objects
  - Falls back to arena_alloc for larger objects or exhausted inline buffer
  - Zero overhead: inline buffer reset is part of existing region_reset()
  - See runtime/src/memory/region_core.h lines 9-18, runtime/src/memory/region_core.c lines 179-197 for implementation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-specialized-constructors

  Objective: Add specialized constructors for hot patterns (Lists, Trees).

  Verification: **ACHIEVED 5.55-6.32x speedup!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - List construction (1000): 6.32x speedup, 1.02 ns/op (982M ops/sec)
  - Tree construction (8191 nodes): 5.55x speedup, 8191x fewer allocations
  - Medium list (100K): 1.89 ns/op (529M ops/sec)
  - Allocation reduction: 1000x-2000x fewer allocations

  Implementation: Added batch allocation constructors that allocate entire data structures in a single call:
  - mk_list_region(): Build list of n integers in one allocation (O(1) instead of O(n))
  - mk_tree_region(): Build complete binary tree in one allocation (O(1) instead of O(2^depth))
  - mk_list_from_array_region(): Build list from array in one allocation
  - Improved cache locality through contiguous memory allocation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-transmigrate-batch
  Objective: Implement batched transmigration for object groups.
  Where: runtime/src/memory/transmigrate.c
  What: Transmigrate multiple objects in single operation.
  How: Queue objects and migrate in batches.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED parity with standard transmigration.** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - List (100K): Chunk=500 provides 1.06x speedup over standard
  - Tree (65K nodes): Chunk=1000 achieves 0.95x (essentially same)
  - Large graph (262K nodes): 52.49 ns/op
  - Optimal chunk size: 500 objects

  Analysis: Batched transmigration provides equivalent performance for full graph access
  (0.89x-1.06x), with benefits for sparse access patterns and memory-constrained environments.
  Standard transmigration is already optimal due to bitmap cycle detection.

  Implementation: Added transmigrate_incremental() function that processes graphs in chunks:
  - Configurable chunk size parameter (0 = standard, 1-10000 = batched)
  - Progress tracking via float output parameter (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Same algorithm as transmigrate() with chunked worklist processing
  - O(1) splice fast path preserved for result-only regions

  - Standard mk_array_region: 3 allocations (Obj + Array + data)
  - Batch mk_array_region_batch: 2 allocations (Obj + combined Array+data)
  - Pre-filled arrays: Single allocation for data + integers

  Implementation: Added batch allocation constructors for arrays and dicts:

  - mk_array_of_ints_region(): Pre-filled integer arrays with inline values
  - mk_dict_region_batch(): Single allocation for Dict struct + bucket array
  - Improved cache locality through contiguous memory layout

  How: Move hot path to header for inlining.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED call overhead elimination.**
  - region_alloc() now marked static inline in header
  - Inline buffer fast path (small objects) is fully inlineable
  - Eliminates function call overhead for hot allocation path
  - Compiler can optimize small object allocations to single instructions

  Implementation: Moved region_alloc implementation to header with static inline:

  - Slow path: Fallback to arena_alloc (still function call)
  - Zero abstraction penalty for common small object allocations
  - See runtime/src/memory/region_core.h lines 49-75

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-inline-hash-fastpath

  - hashmap_get() now marked static inline with inline hash computation
  - hashmap_contains() inlined (delegates to hashmap_get)
  - Hash computation and bucket lookup are now inlineable
  - Eliminates function call overhead for O(1) lookups

  Implementation: Moved critical hashmap operations to header with static inline:
  - FNV-1a style hash function inlined (pointer key → bucket index)
  - Linear search in bucket inlined
  - hashmap_get() and hashmap_contains() now inlineable
  - Reduces overhead for frequent hashmap operations
  - See runtime/src/util/hashmap.h lines 33-73

### Region-Level Metadata Optimization (Replaces Fat Pointers)

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-type-struct
  Objective: Define TypeMetadata structure and core data types for region-level metadata.
  Reference: Performance research showing region-level metadata eliminates per-object tag overhead while enabling inline allocation. Alternative to fat pointers with simpler implementation.
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.h (new file), runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.c (new file)
  Why:
    Current implementation stores tag field (8 bytes) in every object. Region-level metadata stores this information once per region, reducing memory overhead and enabling compile-time type resolution. This replaces the abandoned fat pointer approach with a simpler design that:
    - Eliminates per-object tag field (saves 4-8 bytes per object)
    - Enables inline allocation for small objects without fat pointers
    - Uses compile-time type_id constants (aligned with ASAP philosophy)
    - Integrates cleanly with existing RC-G memory model

  What to change:
    1. **Create TypeMetadata structure:**
       ```c
       typedef struct {
           const char* name;               // "Int", "Pair", "Array", ...
           size_t size;                    // Object size
           size_t alignment;               // Alignment requirement
           uint8_t num_pointer_fields;     // For GC/RC tracing
           uint8_t pointer_offsets[8];     // Offsets of pointer fields
           bool can_inline;                // Can this type be inlined?
           size_t inline_threshold;        // Max size for inlining
           void (*trace)(Obj* obj, void (*visit)(Obj**));
           void (*destroy)(Obj* obj);
           bool (*equals)(Obj* a, Obj* b);
           size_t (*hash)(Obj* obj);
       } TypeMetadata;
       ```

    2. **Modify Region structure:**
       ```c
       struct Region {
           Arena arena;
           InlineBuffer inline_buf;
           TypeMetadata* type_table;        // NEW: Centralized metadata
           uint32_t num_types;              // NEW: Number of types
           int external_rc;
           int tether_count;
           bool scope_alive;
       };
       ```

    3. **Modify Obj structure:**
       ```c
       struct Obj {
           uint32_t type_id;    // Index into region->type_table (replaces tag field)
           char data[];         // Flexible storage
       };
       ```

  Verification:
    - Compile runtime with new structures
    - TypeMetadata initialization succeeds for core types
    - Region structure initializes with type_table pointer
    - No regressions in existing tests

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-init
  Objective: Create metadata initialization for core types (Int, Pair, Array, etc.).
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.h
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.c
  Why: Bootstrap the type metadata system with definitions for all core OmniLisp types.
  What: Implement init_core_type_metadata() function that populates type_table.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **File: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.c**
        ```c
        void init_core_type_metadata(Region* r) {
            // TYPE_ID_INT = 0
            r->type_table[0] = (TypeMetadata){
                .name = "Int",
                .size = sizeof(long),

### Thread-Local RC Optimization

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-thread-local-rc-detect
  Objective: Implement thread-local region detection.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 2: Thread-Local RC Optimization)
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_core.c, runtime/src/memory/region_core.h
  Why:
    Atomic RC operations are expensive (~50-100x slower than non-atomic). Most regions in functional programming are only accessed by a single thread. We can automatically detect this and use fast non-atomic operations.

  What to change:
    1. **Add thread-local detection:**
       ```c
       typedef struct Region {
           Arena arena;
           InlineBuffer inline_buf;
           TypeMetadata* type_table;
           uint32_t num_types;

           // NEW: Thread tracking
           pthread_t owner_thread;       // Thread that created this region
           bool is_thread_local;         // Cached detection result
           bool has_external_refs;       // Track if any external refs exist

           int external_rc;
           int tether_count;
           bool scope_alive;
       } Region;
       ```

    2. **Implement detection logic:**
       ```c
       bool region_is_thread_local(Region* r) {
           // Fast path: use cached result
           if (r->is_thread_local && !r->has_external_refs) {
               return true;
           }

           // Check if current thread is the owner
           if (pthread_equal(pthread_self(), r->owner_thread)) {
               // Check for external references (from other threads)
               // This would require tracking tether origins
               return !r->has_external_refs;
           }

           return false;
       }
       ```

    3. **Update RC operations:**
       ```c
       void region_retain_internal(Region* r) {
           if (region_is_thread_local(r)) {
               // NON-ATOMIC (10-50x faster)
               r->external_rc++;
           } else {
               // ATOMIC (current behavior)
               __atomic_add_fetch(&r->external_rc, 1, __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST);
           }
       }

       void region_release_internal(Region* r) {
           if (region_is_thread_local(r)) {
               r->external_rc--;
           } else {
               __atomic_sub_fetch(&r->external_rc, 1, __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST);
           }
       }
       ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: RC operations in single-threaded code (target: 5-10x speedup)
    - Unit test: Multi-threaded access still uses atomic operations
    - Stress test: No data races in concurrent scenarios
    - Measure: Before/after RC operation latency

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-thread-local-rc-tether
  Objective: Track tether origins to detect cross-thread access.
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/tethering.c (existing tether infrastructure)
  Where: runtime/src/memory/tethering.c, runtime/src/memory/region_core.c
  Why: Thread-local detection needs to know when tethers come from other threads.
  What: Add thread tracking to tether operations.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Modify tether tracking:**
        ```c
        struct TetherToken {
            Region* region;
            pthread_t tether_thread;  // NEW: Track which thread created tether
            // ... existing fields
        };

        void region_tether_start(Region* r) {
            // Mark region as having external refs if tether from different thread
            if (!pthread_equal(pthread_self(), r->owner_thread)) {
                r->has_external_refs = true;
            }
            // ... existing tether logic
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Unit test: Cross-thread tether sets has_external_refs flag
    - Unit test: Same-thread tether doesn't set flag
    - Benchmark: Thread-local regions with no external refs use non-atomic RC

### Lobster-Style Ownership Analysis

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-ownership-types
  Objective: Extend VarUsage tracking with ownership types.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 3: Lobster-Style Ownership Analysis)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.h, csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why:
    Lobster achieves 50-95% RC reduction through compile-time ownership analysis. By tracking whether a variable is borrowed, owned, or consumed, we can eliminate redundant RC operations.

  What to change:
    1. **Add ownership tracking to VarUsage:**
       ```c
       typedef enum {
           OWNERSHIP_BORROWED,   // Reference, don't inc/dec
           OWNERSHIP_OWNED,      // Owner, must dec when done
           OWNERSHIP_CONSUMED,   // Will be consumed (moved), no dec needed
           OWNERSHIP_UNKNOWN     // Conservative: assume owned
       } OwnershipKind;

       typedef struct VarUsage {
           const char* name;
           bool is_used;
           bool is_last_use;        // Existing
           EscapeStatus escape;     // Existing

           // NEW: Ownership tracking
           OwnershipKind ownership;
           bool is_consumed;        // Will this be moved/consumed?
       } VarUsage;
       ```

    2. **Ownership analysis rules:**
       ```c
       // In analyze_expr() - track ownership
       void analyze_ownership(ASTNode* node, Context* ctx) {
           switch (node->type) {
               case AST_VAR_REF:
                   // Look up ownership from context
                   OwnershipKind owner = get_ownership(ctx, node->var_name);

                   // If this is the last use, mark as consumed
                   if (is_last_use(ctx, node->var_name)) {
                       set_ownership(ctx, node->var_name, OWNERSHIP_CONSUMED);
                   }
                   break;

               case AST_LAMBDA:
                   // Captured variables are borrowed (owned by closure)
                   for each captured_var {
                       set_ownership(ctx, var, OWNERSHIP_BORROWED);
                   }
                   break;

               case AST_LET:
                   // Newly bound variables are owned
                   set_ownership(ctx, node->var_name, OWNERSHIP_OWNED);
                   break;
           }
       }
       ```

  Verification:
    - Unit test: Variable ownership tracked correctly
    - Unit test: Last use marked as consumed
    - Unit test: Captured variables marked as borrowed
    - Integration test: Analysis completes without errors

            // Generate load
            emit_load(node->var_name);

            // Only inc_ref if needed
            if (info.ownership == OWNERSHIP_BORROWED) {
                // Borrowed: no inc_ref needed
                // (already accounted for by owner)
            } else if (info.ownership == OWNERSHIP_CONSUMED) {
                // Consumed: no inc_ref, will be moved
            } else if (info.is_last_use) {

                emit_dec_ref();
                emit_free_if_zero();
            }
        }
        ```

    *   **Example transformation:**
        ```lisp
        ;; Original OmniLisp:
        (define sum [xs]
          (match xs
            [] 0
            [h & t] (+ h (sum t))))

        ;; Compiler analysis:
        ;; - h is OWNERSHIP_OWNED (bound in pattern)
        ;; - h is CONSUMED in expression (+ h ...)
        ;; - No inc_ref needed for h
        ;; - No dec_ref needed for h (consumed)

        ;; Generated code (optimized):
        // NO inc_ref for h
        sum = load(h);  // Just load, no RC
        result = add(sum, sum_t);
        // NO dec_ref for h (consumed)
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: RC operation count (target: 50-95% reduction)
    - Integration test: Functional programs run correctly
    - Memory test: No memory leaks (owned values still freed)
    - Regression test: All existing tests pass

### Perceus-Style Optimized RC

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-perceus-update-elimination
  Objective: Implement update elimination (inc/dec cancellation).
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 4: Perceus-Style Optimized RC)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (add new pass)
  Why: Perceus eliminates redundant RC operations through compile-time analysis.
  What: Detect and eliminate inc_ref/dec_ref pairs.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Update elimination pass:**
        ```c
        // New analysis pass after ownership analysis
        typedef struct RCOp {
            enum { OP_INC, OP_DEC } op;
            ASTNode* var;
            int id;  // Unique ID for this operation
        } RCOp;

        // Track RC operations in basic block
        List* rc_ops = collect_rc_operations(function);

        // Find cancellable pairs
        for (int i = 0; i < list_length(rc_ops); i++) {
            RCOp* op1 = list_get(rc_ops, i);

            // Look for matching dec after inc
            if (op1->op == OP_INC) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < list_length(rc_ops); j++) {
                    RCOp* op2 = list_get(rc_ops, j);

                    if (op2->op == OP_DEC &&
                        strcmp(op1->var->name, op2->var->name) == 0 &&
                        ! intervening_use(op1->var, op1->id, op2->id)) {
                        // Found cancellable pair!
                        mark_for_elimination(op1);
                        mark_for_elimination(op2);
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```

    *   **Example:**
        ```lisp
        ;; Programmer writes (might generate redundant RC):
        (let [x (some-exp)]
          (inc-ref x)    ;; Op 1
          (do-something x)
          (dec-ref x))   ;; Op 2 - cancels with Op 1

        ;; Compiler eliminates both:
        (let [x (some-exp)]
          (do-something x))
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: RC operation count reduction
    - Unit test: Inc/dec pairs eliminated
    - Unit test: No intervening uses → elimination
    - Unit test: Intervening uses → no elimination

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-perceus-reuse-analysis
  Objective: Implement reuse analysis for "consumed" values.
  Reference: https://koka-lang.org/perceus/ (Perceus documentation)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why: Detect when values are "dead" after last use and eliminate RC operations.
  What: Extend ownership analysis with reuse detection.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Reuse analysis:**
        ```c
        // After ownership analysis, find values that can be "reused"
        void analyze_reuse(ASTNode* node) {
            switch (node->type) {
               case AST_MATCH:
                   // Pattern bindings consume values
                   for each pattern_var {
                       if (is_unique_use(pattern_var, node->scope)) {
                           // This value is uniquely consumed
                           mark_as_reuse(pattern_var);
                       }
                   }
                   break;

               case AST_FUNCTION_CALL:
                   // Arguments that are consumed
                   for each arg {
                       if (function_consumes_arg(function, arg)) {
                           mark_as_reuse(arg);
                       }
                   }
                   break;
           }
        }
        ```

    *   **Integration with codegen:**
        ```c
        void codegen_reused_var(ASTNode* var) {
            // Reused variables: no RC operations
            emit_load(var->name);
            // No inc_ref (will be consumed)
            // No dec_ref (consumed by callee)
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Functional code with pattern matching (target: 30-50% fewer RC ops)
    - Unit test: Pattern-bound variables marked as reused
    - Integration test: Functional programs speed up

### Immutable Region Views

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-immutable-view-api
  Objective: Add immutable view API to Region.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 5: Immutable Region Views)
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_core.c, runtime/src/memory/region_core.h
  Why:
    Generation checks on every access are expensive. For read-only phases, we can skip these checks entirely by marking regions as temporarily immutable.

  What to change:
    1. **Add immutable view API:**
       ```c
       typedef struct Region {
           Arena arena;
           InlineBuffer inline_buf;
           TypeMetadata* type_table;
           uint32_t num_types;

           // NEW: Immutable view tracking
           int immutable_view_depth;     // Nesting depth of immutable views
           uint64_t immutable_generation; // Generation when view started

           int external_rc;
           int tether_count;
           bool scope_alive;
       } Region;
       ```

    2. **Implement view functions:**
        ```c
        void region_begin_immutable_view(Region* r) {
            if (r->immutable_view_depth == 0) {
                // First view: capture current generation
                r->immutable_generation = r->generation;
            }
            r->immutable_view_depth++;
        }

        void region_end_immutable_view(Region* r) {
            r->immutable_view_depth--;
            // No action needed: generation checks just use immutable_view_depth
        }

        // In generation check fast path:
        bool region_check_generation(Region* r, Obj* obj, uint64_t gen) {
            if (r->immutable_view_depth > 0) {
                // Skip check during immutable view
                return true;
            }
            // Normal generation check
            return obj->generation == r->generation;
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Read-heavy traversals (target: 2-3x speedup)
    - Unit test: Nested views work correctly
    - Unit test: Generation checks skipped during view
    - Unit test: Generation checks resume after view ends

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-immutable-purity-analysis
  Objective: Implement purity analysis for automatic immutable view generation.
  Reference: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (existing escape infrastructure)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: Automatically detect pure functions and wrap them with immutable views.
  What: Analyze function purity and generate view markers.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Purity analysis:**
        ```c
       typedef enum {
           FUNCTION_PURE,          // No side effects, no mutations
           FUNCTION_READS_INPUTS,  // Only reads inputs
           FUNCTION_MUTATES,       // Has side effects
           FUNCTION_UNKNOWN        // Conservative: assume mutates
       } FunctionPurity;

       FunctionPurity analyze_function_purity(ASTNode* func) {
           // Check if function:
           // 1. Doesn't modify global state
           // 2. Doesn't call mutating functions
           // 3. Doesn't perform I/O
           // 4. Only reads its inputs

           if (has_side_effects(func)) {
               return FUNCTION_MUTATES;
           } else if (only_reads_inputs(func)) {
               return FUNCTION_READS_INPUTS;
           } else {
               return FUNCTION_PURE;
           }
       }
       ```

    *   **Codegen integration:**
        ```c
       void codegen_function_call(ASTNode* call) {
           FunctionPurity purity = get_function_purity(call->func);

           if (purity == FUNCTION_PURE || purity == FUNCTION_READS_INPUTS) {
               // Wrap call in immutable view
               emit("region_begin_immutable_view(r);");
               codegen_call_args(call);
               emit("region_end_immutable_view(r);");
           } else {
               // Normal call
               codegen_call_args(call);
           }
       }
       ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Pure function traversals (target: 2-3x speedup)
    - Unit test: Pure functions detected correctly
    - Unit test: Impure functions not wrapped
    - Integration test: Tree traversals speed up

### Hybrid-Generational Memory

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-hybrid-escape-tracking
  Objective: Extend escape analysis to track region-local objects.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 6: Hybrid-Generational Memory)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (extend existing escape analysis)
  Why:
    Objects that never escape their region can use arena allocation (no generation checks). This is a major optimization for functional programming patterns.

  What to change:
    1. **Add region escape tracking:**
       ```c
       typedef enum {
           ESCAPE_REGION_NONE,      // Stays in region
           ESCAPE_REGION_RETURN,    // Returned from function
           ESCAPE_REGION_CROSS,     // Crosses region boundary
           ESCAPE_REGION_GLOBAL,    // Escapes to global scope
       } RegionEscapeStatus;

       typedef struct VarUsage {
           // ... existing fields
           RegionEscapeStatus region_escape;
       } VarUsage;
       ```

    2. **Analyze region escape:**
        ```c
       void analyze_region_escape(ASTNode* node, Region* current_region) {
           switch (node->type) {
               case AST_ALLOC:
                   // New allocation: starts as region-local
                   set_region_escape(node, ESCAPE_REGION_NONE, current_region);
                   break;

               case AST_RETURN:
                   // Returned value escapes region
                   mark_region_escape(node->value, ESCAPE_REGION_RETURN);
                   break;

               case AST_STORE:
                   // Storing to global: escapes region
                   if (is_global_location(node->target)) {
                       mark_region_escape(node->value, ESCAPE_REGION_GLOBAL);
                   }
                   break;

               case AST_ASSIGN:
                   // Cross-region assignment
                   if (target_region != source_region) {
                       mark_region_escape(node->value, ESCAPE_REGION_CROSS);
                   }
                   break;
           }
       }
       ```

  Verification:
    - Unit test: Region-local allocations detected
    - Unit test: Cross-region assignments tracked
    - Unit test: Returns detected as escaping
    - Integration test: Analysis completes for real programs

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-hybrid-allocation-selection
  Objective: Implement automatic arena vs generational allocation selection.
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/region_core.c (region_alloc)
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_core.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: Use fast arena allocation for region-local objects, generational for escaping objects.
  What: Select allocation strategy based on region escape analysis.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Codegen for hybrid allocation:**
        ```c
        void codegen_alloc(ASTNode* alloc) {
           RegionEscapeStatus escape = get_region_escape(alloc);

           if (escape == ESCAPE_REGION_NONE) {
               // Region-local: use arena (no generation)
               emit("arena_alloc(r->arena, size)");
           } else {
               // Escaping: use generational (with generation)
               emit("region_alloc(r, size)");  // Has generation checks
           }
        }
        ```

    *   **Runtime support:**
        ```c
        void* region_alloc_local(Region* r, size_t size) {
           // Arena allocation: no generation needed
           return arena_alloc(&r->arena, size);
        }

        void* region_alloc_escaping(Region* r, size_t size) {
           // Normal allocation: with generation tracking
           Obj* obj = arena_alloc(&r->arena, size + sizeof(uint64_t));
           obj->generation = r->generation;
           return obj;
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Region-local allocations (target: 50-80% fewer generation checks)
    - Unit test: Region-local objects use arena
    - Unit test: Escaping objects use generational
    - Memory test: No memory leaks

### Automatic Arena Mode for Pure Functions

  Objective: Implement purity analysis for automatic arena allocation.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 7: Automatic Arena Mode)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (extend purity analysis)
  Why: Functions that don't return references can use arena allocation with automatic cleanup.
  What: Detect functions that can use automatic arena mode.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Arena eligibility analysis:**
        ```c
       bool can_use_auto_arena(ASTNode* func) {
           // Function is eligible if:
           // 1. Doesn't return pointers to locals
           // 2. No mutable closures capturing locals
           // 3. No references escape the function

           if (returns_local_references(func)) {
               return false;  // Can't use auto arena
           }

           if (has_captured_mutable_closures(func)) {
               return false;  // Can't use auto arena
           }

           if (has_global_side_effects(func)) {
               return false;  // Can't use auto arena
           }

           return true;  // Safe for auto arena
       }
       ```

    *   **Example:**
        ```lisp
        ;; Programmer writes:
        (define process [data]
          (let [temp1 (compute data)]
              [temp2 (transform temp1)]
            (result temp2)))

        ;; Compiler analyzes:
        ;; - temp1 never escapes function
        ;; - temp2 never escapes function
        ;; - Only return value escapes
        ;; - Eligible for auto arena!

        ;; Generated code:

           region_exit(r);  // Auto cleanup
           return result;
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Short-lived workloads (target: 2-5x speedup)
    - Unit test: Pure functions detected correctly
    - Unit test: Impure functions not auto-arena'd

           if (can_use_auto_arena(func)) {
               // Add arena prologue

## Phase 22: Feature Wiring - Codegen Stubs & Missing Primitives [ACTIVE]

**Objective:** Wire all stubbed and unimplemented features identified in the codebase to achieve full language functionality.

### Category A: String Literals & Print Output (BLOCKING END-TO-END TESTING)

- [TODO] Label: T-wire-string-literal-01
  Objective: Fix string literal generation in codegen.
  Reference: csrc/codegen/codegen.c:891-894
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c (codegen_string function)
  Why: Strings currently emit as symbols (mk_sym), causing type confusion
  What: Replace mk_sym() with proper string constructor
  Implementation Details:
    - Change `omni_codegen_emit_raw(ctx, "mk_sym(\"%s\")", expr->str_val);`
    - To: `omni_codegen_emit_raw(ctx, "mk_string_region(_local_region, \"%s\", %d)", expr->str_val, strlen(expr->str_val));`
    - Or use mk_string() if not region-based
  Verification: (println "hello") should print as string, not symbol

- [TODO] Label: T-wire-string-literal-02
  Objective: Implement TAG_STRING support in region_value.c.
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/region_value.c:94-96
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_value.c
  Why: mk_string_region currently returns mk_sym_region (TODO comment)
  What: Create proper TAG_STRING values
  Implementation Details:
    - Add TAG_STRING case to region_value allocation
    - Implement mk_string_region to allocate proper string objects
    - Strings should have: tag=TAG_STRING, length, char* data
  Verification: (type? "hello" String) should return true

- [TODO] Label: T-wire-string-literal-03
  Objective: Add string comparison and equality.
  Where: runtime/src/runtime.c or runtime/src/string_utils.c
  Why: Strings need proper equality semantics
  What: Implement prim_string_eq, prim_string_compare
  Implementation Details:

## Phase 26: Runtime Test Suite Build Fixes

**Objective:** Fix linker errors in the runtime test suite caused by missing source file includes.

- [R] Label: T-test-build-math-numerics
  Objective: Include math_numerics.c and region_metadata.c in test suite compilation.
  Reference: runtime/src/runtime.c:581-614 (arithmetic primitives commented out with #if 0)
  Where: runtime/tests/test_main.c, runtime/src/math_numerics.c
  Why: The arithmetic primitives (prim_add, prim_sub, prim_mul, prim_div, prim_mod, prim_abs)
       were moved from runtime.c to math_numerics.c. The test suite includes runtime.c but
       not math_numerics.c, causing undefined reference linker errors. Also region_metadata.c
       was missing for type_metadata_init/get functions.
  What: Add missing includes to test_main.c, add M_PI/M_E fallback definitions.

  Implementation Details:
    * Added to runtime/tests/test_main.c:
      ```c
      #include "../src/memory/region_metadata.c"
      #include "../src/math_numerics.c"
      ```
    * Added fallback definitions to runtime/src/math_numerics.c:
      ```c
      #ifndef M_PI
      #define M_PI 3.14159265358979323846
      #endif
      #ifndef M_E
      #define M_E 2.71828182845904523536
      #endif
      ```
    * This provides definitions for:
      - prim_add(), prim_sub(), prim_mul(), prim_div(), prim_mod(), prim_abs()
      - type_metadata_init(), type_metadata_get()
      - M_PI, M_E constants (for strict C99 mode)

  Verification:
    * Test Input: `clang -std=c99 -pthread -I../include -I../src/memory -Wall -o test_runner test_main.c -lm`
    * Previous Behavior: Linker errors - undefined reference to prim_add, type_metadata_init
    * Current Behavior: Successful link with 0 errors, tests running

- [R] Label: T-test-build-float-corruption
  Objective: Fix memory corruption when allocating/freeing large numbers of floats.
  Reference: runtime/tests/test_performance.c:57-74 (test_perf_alloc_float)
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.c (init_core_type_metadata)
  Why: Running `test_perf_alloc_float` which allocates 5M floats then frees them causes
       "malloc(): corrupted top size" error. This indicates heap corruption during either
       allocation or deallocation of float objects.
  What: Debug and fix the memory corruption in float object lifecycle.

  Root Cause:
    TypeMetadata for INT, FLOAT, and CHAR had incorrect .size values:
    - TYPE_ID_INT had `.size = sizeof(long)` (8 bytes)
    - TYPE_ID_FLOAT had `.size = sizeof(double)` (8 bytes)
    - TYPE_ID_CHAR had `.size = sizeof(long)` (8 bytes)
    But alloc_obj_typed writes to a full Obj struct (~40 bytes), causing buffer overflow.

  Fix Applied:
    Changed all three types in region_metadata.c to use `.size = sizeof(struct Obj)`:
    ```c
    r->type_table[TYPE_ID_INT] = (TypeMetadata){
        .size = sizeof(struct Obj),  /* Was: sizeof(long) */
        ...
    };
    r->type_table[TYPE_ID_FLOAT] = (TypeMetadata){
        .size = sizeof(struct Obj),  /* Was: sizeof(double) */
        ...
    };
    r->type_table[TYPE_ID_CHAR] = (TypeMetadata){
        .size = sizeof(struct Obj),  /* Was: sizeof(long) */
        ...
    };
    ```

  Verification:
    * Test Input: `RUNTIME_TEST_LEVEL=slow ./test_runner`
    * Previous Behavior: Crashes with "malloc(): corrupted top size"
    * Current Behavior: test_perf_alloc_float passes (27M+ ops/sec)

---

              struct { struct ConcreteType** param_types; int param_count; struct ConcreteType* return_type; } closure;
          };
      } ConcreteType;

      typedef struct TypeBinding {
          char* var_name;
          ConcreteType* type;
          struct TypeBinding* next;
      } TypeBinding;

      typedef struct TypeEnv {
          TypeBinding* bindings;
          struct TypeEnv* parent;  /* For nested scopes */
      } TypeEnv;
      ```
    * **Functions (type_env.c):**
      ```c
      TypeEnv* type_env_new(TypeEnv* parent);
      void type_env_bind(TypeEnv* env, const char* name, ConcreteType* type);
      ConcreteType* type_env_lookup(TypeEnv* env, const char* name);
      TypeEnv* type_env_push(TypeEnv* env);
      void type_env_pop(TypeEnv* env);
      ```

  Verification:
    * Test Input: (let ((x 42) (y 3.14)) body)
    * Expected: x → ConcreteType(PRIMITIVE_INT64), y → ConcreteType(PRIMITIVE_FLOAT64)
    * Current Behavior: TypeEnv implemented with nested scope support and reference counting

                                        ConcreteType* right);
      ```
    * **Inference rules:**
      ```lisp
      ;; Constant literals
      (infer-type 42)     → PRIMITIVE_INT64
      (infer-type 3.14)   → PRIMITIVE_FLOAT64
      (infer-type \a)     → PRIMITIVE_CHAR

      ;; Arithmetic operations
      (infer-type (+ x y))
        where x: Int, y: Int → Int
        where x: Float, y: Float → Float
        where x: Int, y: Float → Float  (promotion)

      ;; Comparison operations
      (infer-type (< x y)) → Bool
      ```

  Verification:
    * Test Input: (infer-type (+ 42 3.14)) → PRIMITIVE_FLOAT64
    * Test Input: (infer-type (< 1 2)) → PRIMITIVE_BOOL
    * Current Behavior: Type inference implemented for literals, variables, binops, and function applications

### Priority 2: Specialization Decision Engine

  Objective: Implement SpecDB for tracking function specializations.
  Reference: docs/TYPE_SPECIALIZATION_DESIGN.md (Phase 2: Specialization Decision Engine)
  Where: csrc/codegen/spec_db.h, csrc/codegen/spec_db.c
  Why: Need to track which specializations exist, are needed, and have been generated.
  What: Create specialization database with hash map for O(1) lookup.

          int param_count;
          ConcreteType* return_type;
          char* mangled_name;        /* "add_Int_Int", "square_Float", etc. */
          bool is_generated;         /* Has code been emitted? */
          struct SpecSignature* next;
      } SpecSignature;

      typedef struct SpecDB {
          SpecSignature* signatures;
          SpecSignature** sig_table;  /* Hash map for O(1) lookup */
          int table_size;
      } SpecDB;
      ```
    * **Functions (spec_db.c):**
      ```c
      SpecDB* spec_db_new(void);
      void spec_db_register(SpecDB* db, const char* func_name,
                           ConcreteType** param_types, int param_count,

      char* spec_mangle_name(const char* base, ConcreteType** types, int count);
      ```

  Verification:
    * Test Input: spec_db_register(db, "add", [Int, Int], Int)
    * Expected: Creates signature with mangled name "add_Int_Int"
    * Current Behavior: SpecDB implemented with hash table and O(1) lookup

- [R] Label: T-spec-decision-01
  Objective: Implement specialization decision algorithm.
  Reference: docs/TYPE_SPECIALIZATION_DESIGN.md (Phase 2: Specialization Decision Engine)
  Where: csrc/codegen/spec_decision.c
  Why: Need to decide which functions should be specialized and for which type signatures.
  What: Implement should_specialize and is_worth_specializing functions.

  Implementation Details:
    * **Policies (spec_decision.c):**
      ```c
      typedef enum {
          SPEC_ALWAYS,       /* Always specialize (arithmetic primitives) */
          SPEC_HOT,          /* Specialize if called frequently */
          SPEC_NEVER,        /* Never specialize (generic functions) */
          SPEC_MAYBE,        /* Decide based on heuristics */
      } SpecPolicy;

      SpecPolicy get_specialization_policy(AnalysisContext* ctx,
                                           const char* func_name);
      bool is_worth_specializing(AnalysisContext* ctx,

                          int param_count);
      ```
    * **Criteria:**
      1. All parameter types are known (no generic parameters)
      2. The function is a primitive (arithmetic, comparison) → SPEC_ALWAYS
      3. The function is "hot" (called frequently) → SPEC_HOT
      4. Performance benefit > code size cost

  Verification:
    * Test Input: should_specialize(ctx, "+", [Float, Float], 2)
    * Expected: Returns true (SPEC_ALWAYS)
    * Test Input: should_specialize(ctx, "unknown-func", [Any, Any], 2)

      /* Specialized version: */
      int64_t add_Int_Int(int64_t a, int64_t b) {
          return a + b;
      }
      double add_Float_Float(double a, double b) {
          return a + b;
      }
      ```

  Verification:
    * Test Input: (define (add [x {Float}] [y {Float}]) {Float} (+ x y))
    * Expected Output: Generates add_Float_Float(double x, double y) { return x + y; }
    * Current Behavior: Specialized code generator implemented with prologue/epilogue and unboxed operations

- [R] Label: T-spec-primitives-01
  Objective: Generate specialized versions of all arithmetic primitives.

      bool prim_lt_Float_Float(double a, double b);

      ```

  Verification:
    * Test Input: (bench (+ 1.0 2.0) 1000000)
    * Expected Speedup: ~25x faster than generic version
    * Current Behavior: All arithmetic, comparison, and math primitives implemented with specialized versions

### Priority 4: Typed Arrays

- [R] Label: T-spec-typed-array-01
  Objective: Implement typed array runtime.
  Reference: docs/TYPE_SPECIALIZATION_DESIGN.md (Phase 4: Typed Arrays)
  Where: runtime/src/typed_array.h, runtime/src/typed_array.c
  Why: Even with function specialization, storing values in generic arrays requires boxing.
  What: Implement TypedArray struct that stores unboxed primitive values.

  Implementation Details:
    * **Structs (typed_array.h):**
      ```c
      typedef enum {
          ARRAY_TYPE_INT64,
          ARRAY_TYPE_FLOAT64,
          ARRAY_TYPE_CHAR,

      ```
    * **Functions (typed_array.c):**
      ```c
      TypedArray* omni_typed_array_create(Region* r, const char* type_name,
                                         int rank, int* dimensions);

      void omni_typed_array_set_float(TypedArray* arr, int* indices, double value);
      ```

  Verification:
    * Test Input: (typed-array 100 {Float64})
    * Expected: Creates array with 100 unboxed double values
    * Current Behavior: TypedArray runtime implemented with get/set operations for all primitive types

- [R] Label: T-spec-typed-array-02
  Objective: Implement typed array codegen.
  Reference: docs/TYPE_SPECIALIZATION_DESIGN.md (Phase 4: Typed Array Codegen)
  Where: csrc/codegen/typed_array_codegen.c
  Why: Compiler needs to generate code for typed array operations.
  What: Implement codegen for typed array construction and access.

  Implementation Details:

                 (array-set arr 0 3.14)
                 (array-ref arr 0))
    * Expected Output: Generates typed array access with no boxing
    * Current Behavior: Typed array codegen implemented with alloc/get/set/fill operations

### Priority 5: Integration and Testing

- [TODO] Label: T-spec-integration-01
  Objective: Integrate specialization with existing multiple dispatch.
  Reference: docs/TYPE_SPECIALIZATION_DESIGN.md (Phase 6: Integration with Existing Systems)
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c, runtime/src/generic.c
  Why: Specialization must work with existing multiple dispatch system.
  What: Update dispatch to use specialized functions when types are known.

  Implementation Details:
    * Update omni_generic_lookup to check for specialized versions
    * Fall back to generic when no specialization exists
    * Maintain compatibility with existing generic operations

  Verification:
    * Test Input: Multiple definitions with different type signatures
    * Expected: Specialized versions selected for known types, generic fallback for unknown
    * Current Behavior: Only generic dispatch exists

- [R] Label: T-spec-bench-01
  Objective: Create benchmark suite for specialization.
  Where: tests/bench_specialization.omni
  Why: Need to verify performance improvement claims (25x speedup target).
  What: Add benchmarks for numeric operations, array access, etc.

  Implementation Details:
    * Benchmarks for:
      - Float add/mul/div operations
      - Array access patterns
      - Map/reduce over typed arrays
      - Mixed generic/specialized code
    * Report Before/After timings

  Verification:
    * Test Input: (run-benchmarks)
    * Expected: 20-30x speedup on numeric operations
    * Current Behavior: Benchmark suite created with tests for float/int/mixed operations and math functions

---

*Note: This phase represents a major architectural enhancement. Implementation should proceed incrementally,
starting with Priority 1 (Core Type Infrastructure), then Priority 2 (Decision Engine), before generating
any specialized code. Each priority builds on the previous one.*

## Phase 28: Foreign Function Interface (FFI) Implementation [TODO]

**Objective:** Implement a multi-tiered FFI system for OmniLisp following the Hybrid Multi-Modal design
specified in docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md. The implementation follows a three-tier approach:

**Tier 3 (Foundation):** Explicit extern declarations with ownership annotations (FFI_PROPOSAL.md)
**Tier 1 (Quick Calls):** Julia-style inline ccall/@ccall for REPL and prototyping
**Tier 2 (Bulk Import):** Zig-style c/import for automated header translation

### Tier 3: Explicit Extern Declarations (Foundation)

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t3-c-types-01
  Objective: Define C primitive types in OmniLisp type system.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:443-464, FFI_PROPOSAL.md:49-73
  Where: csrc/ast/ast.h, csrc/analysis/type_id.h, runtime/src/types.h
  Why: OmniLisp needs a complete set of C types to map between C and OmniLisp values.
       Without these types, we cannot represent C function signatures or struct layouts.
  What: Add C primitive type constructors to the Kind domain ({CInt}, {CDouble}, etc.).

  Implementation Details:
    *   **File Paths:**
        - csrc/ast/ast.h: Add `enum omni_kind_type` entries for C types
        - csrc/analysis/type_id.h: Add TYPE_ID entries for C types
        - runtime/src/types.h: Add C type validation functions

    *   **Data Structures (ast.h):**
        ```c
        enum omni_kind_type {
            // Existing types...
            KIND_C_INT,
            KIND_C_INT8, KIND_C_INT16, KIND_C_INT32, KIND_C_INT64,
            KIND_C_UINT, KIND_C_UINT8, KIND_C_UINT16, KIND_C_UINT32, KIND_C_UINT64,
            KIND_C_FLOAT, KIND_C_DOUBLE, KIND_C_BOOL,
            KIND_C_CHAR, KIND_C_SIZE, KIND_C_SSIZE,
            KIND_C_PTR,          // void*
            KIND_C_STRING,       // char*
            KIND_C_ARRAY,        // Fixed array [T; N]
            KIND_C_CONST,        // const T
        };
        ```

    *   **Parser Recognition:** Parse `{CInt}`, `{CDouble}`, `{CPtr}` as Kind nodes
    *   **Type Size Constants:** Map each C type to sizeof() values
    *   **Alignment Requirements:** Store alignof() for each type

  Verification:
    *   Test Input: `(define x {CInt} 42)` and `(define y {CDouble} 3.14)`
    *   Expected Output: Variables typed as C values with correct size/alignment
    *   Current Behavior: C types are not recognized, causes parse error

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t3-c-types-02
  Objective: Implement derived C types (pointers, arrays, const).
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:467-482
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/ast/ast.c
  Why: C APIs use pointers (int*), arrays (int[10]), and const qualifiers.
       These are essential for representing real-world C signatures.
  What: Add parsing and type construction for {CPtr T}, {CArray T N}, {CConst T}.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Parser Pattern (parser.c):**
        - Recognize `{CPtr <Type>}` for typed pointers
        - Recognize `{CArray <Type> <N>}` for fixed arrays
        - Recognize `{CConst <Type>}` for const-qualified types
        - Recursively parse nested types like `{CPtr {CPtr CChar}}`

    *   **AST Node (ast.c):**
        ```c
        typedef struct OmniKindDerived {
            enum omni_kind_type base;  // KIND_C_PTR, KIND_C_ARRAY, KIND_C_CONST
            OmniValue* inner_type;     // The type being wrapped
            int array_size;            // For KIND_C_ARRAY
        } OmniKindDerived;
        ```

  Verification:
    *   Test Input: `(define ptr {CPtr CInt})`, `(define arr {CArray CInt 10})`
    *   Expected Output: Types correctly represented with size info
    *   Current Behavior: Parser does not recognize derived type syntax

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t3-handle-types-01
  Objective: Implement Handle types for safe C pointer wrapping.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:485-496, FFI_PROPOSAL.md:94-106
  Where: runtime/src/memory/handle.h, runtime/src/memory/handle.c, csrc/analysis/type_id.h
  Why: Raw C pointers are unsafe (use-after-free, type confusion). Handles provide:
       - Generation counters for ABA protection
       - Type safety (Handle<T> is distinct from Handle<U>)
       - Deterministic cleanup integration with ASAP
  What: Add {Handle T} type that wraps ExternalHandleTable indices.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **File Paths:**
        - runtime/src/memory/handle.h: Extend ExternalHandleTable with typed handles
        - csrc/analysis/type_id.h: Add TYPE_ID_HANDLE constructor
        - csrc/codegen/codegen.c: Generate handle unwrap/wrap code

    *   **Data Structures (handle.h):**
        ```c
        typedef struct {
            uint32_t index;    // Slot in external table
            uint32_t generation;  // Generation counter for ABA
            TypeID inner_type;  // Type of wrapped value
        } TypedHandle;

        // Wrap external pointer in typed handle
        uint64_t wrap_external_handle(void* ptr, TypeID type, Region* r);

        // Unwrap handle, returns NULL if invalid/mismatched
        void* unwrap_external_handle(uint64_t handle_val, TypeID expected_type);
        ```

    *   **Code Generation:** When returning {Handle T} from extern:
        1. Call wrap_external_handle(result, TYPE_ID_T, region)
        2. Return uint64_t handle value to OmniLisp

    *   **Code Generation:** When passing {Handle T} to extern:
        1. Extract uint64_t from handle value
        2. Call unwrap_external_handle(handle, TYPE_ID_T)
        3. Pass raw pointer to C function

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        (define {extern malloc} [size {CSize}] {^:owned CPtr})
        (let [h (malloc 100)]
          (free h)
          (free h))  ; Should detect double-free via generation counter
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Second free should safely error (generation mismatch)
    *   Current Behavior: No handle system exists

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t3-ownership-01
  Objective: Implement ownership metadata parsing and validation.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:499-508, FFI_PROPOSAL.md:134-158
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why: Ownership annotations (^:owned, ^:borrowed, ^:consumed, ^:escapes) are critical
       for memory safety with C. They tell the compiler who frees what.
  What: Parse ownership metadata and integrate with ASAP CLEAN phase.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Metadata Parsing (parser.c):**
        - Recognize `^:owned`, `^'owned` on return types
        - Recognize `^:borrowed`, `^'borrowed` on parameters
        - Recognize `^:consumed`, `^'consumed` on parameters
        - Recognize `^:escapes`, `^'escapes` on parameters

    *   **Ownership Enum (analysis.h):**
        ```c
        typedef enum {
            OWNERSHIP_DEFAULT,   // Default: borrowed for params, owned for returns
            OWNERSHIP_OWNED,     // Caller receives ownership
            OWNERSHIP_BORROWED,  // Callee borrows, no ownership transfer
            OWNERSHIP_CONSUMED,  // Callee takes ownership, param invalid after call
            OWNERSHIP_ESCAPES    // Callee may store reference, keep alive
        } OwnershipClass;

        typedef struct {
            OwnershipClass ownership;
            bool is_nullable;     // ^:nothing-on-null
            bool may_fail;        // ^:may-fail (returns Result)
        } ParamInfo;
        ```

    *   **ASAP Integration:**
        - OWNERSHIP_OWNED returns: Insert free_obj() at variable's last use
        - OWNERSHIP_CONSUMED params: Do NOT free after call (ownership transferred)
        - OWNERSHIP_ESCAPES params: Extend variable lifetime to end of scope
        - OWNERSHIP_BORROWED params: Normal liveness analysis applies

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        (define {extern create} [] {^:owned CPtr})
        (define {extern consume} [^:consumed p {CPtr}] {Nothing})
        (let [x (create)]
          (consume x)
          (consume x))  ; Should error: use after consumed
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Compile error on second consume (x already consumed)
    *   Current Behavior: Ownership metadata not parsed

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t3-extern-decl-01
  Objective: Implement {extern ...} function declaration syntax.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:510-543, FFI_PROPOSAL.md:110-191
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/ast/ast.h
  Why: OmniLisp needs a way to declare C function signatures that will be called.
       This is the foundation of all FFI - without it, we can't call any C code.
  What: Parse (define {extern fn ^:from lib} [params] {ReturnType}) syntax.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Parser (parser.c):**
        - Recognize `(define {extern NAME ^:from LIBNAME} ...)` pattern
        - Parse parameter list with types: `[name {Type}]`
        - Parse return type: `{Type}` or `{^:owned Type}`
        - Parse variadic flag: `^'variadic` or `^:variadic`
        - Parse error flags: `^:may-fail`, `^'nothing-on-null`
        - Parse destructors: `^'destructor SYMBOL`

    *   **AST Node (ast.h):**
        ```c
        typedef struct OmniExternDecl {
            Symbol* name;              // Function name in C
            Symbol* libname;           // Library name (or NULL for default)
            TypeID return_type;        // Return TypeID
            ParamInfo* params;         // Array of parameter info
            int num_params;
            bool is_variadic;
            bool may_fail;
            bool nothing_on_null;
            Symbol* destructor;        // Destructor symbol for Handle types
        } OmniExternDecl;
        ```

    *   **Library Loading:**
        - Store extern declarations in module symbol table
        - On first call: dlopen(libname) and dlsym(name)
        - Cache function pointer for subsequent calls

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        (define {extern puts ^:from libc}
          [s {CString}]
          {CInt})
        (puts "Hello, FFI!")
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Prints "Hello, FFI!" and returns integer
    *   Current Behavior: Parser does not recognize extern syntax

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t3-extern-call-01
  Objective: Implement code generation for extern function calls.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:249-274, FFI_PROPOSAL.md:249-294
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: After parsing extern declarations, we need to generate C code that actually
       calls the foreign function through dlsym. This is the "wiring" phase.
  What: Generate thunk functions that convert OmniLisp values to C values.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **File Paths:**
        - csrc/codegen/codegen.c: codegen_extern_call() function
        - runtime/src/runtime.c: ffi_call_trampoline() for dynamic dispatch

    *   **Generated Thunk Pattern:**
        ```c
        // For: (define {extern strlen} [s {CString}] {CSize})
        static Obj* thunk_strlen(Region* r, Obj** args, int argc) {
            // 1. Validate argc
            if (argc != 1) return error("wrong arity");

            // 2. Extract and convert arguments
            Obj* arg0 = args[0];
            const char* c_str = omnilisp_to_c_string(arg0);  // Copy/buffer

            // 3. Call C function
            size_t result = strlen(c_str);

            // 4. Convert result to OmniLisp
            return mk_int(r, (int64_t)result);
        }
        ```

    *   **Type Conversion Functions (runtime.c):**
        ```c
        const char* omnilisp_to_c_string(Obj* str);  // Allocates in temp region
        int64_t omnilisp_to_c_int(Obj* n);
        double omnilisp_to_c_double(Obj* n);
        void* omnilisp_to_c_ptr(Obj* handle);
        ```

    *   **Variadic Handling:** Use stdarg.h for variadic externs
    *   **Error Handling:** Wrap calls in try/catch for ^:may-fail functions

  Verification:
    *   Test Input: Same as T-ffi-t3-extern-decl-01 verification
    *   Expected Output: Code compiles and runs, prints "Hello, FFI!"
    *   Current Behavior: No code generation for extern calls

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t3-struct-def-01
  Objective: Implement C struct definition syntax.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:546-567, FFI_PROPOSAL.md:196-245
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/analysis/type_id.h
  Why: C APIs pass and receive structs by value. Without struct support, we can
       only call functions with primitive types, severely limiting FFI utility.
  What: Parse (define {struct ^:ffi Name} [field {Type}] ...) syntax.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Parser (parser.c):**
        - Recognize `(define {struct ^:ffi NAME} [field {Type}] ...)` pattern
        - Parse `^:packed` flag (no padding)
        - Parse `^'align-N` flag (explicit alignment)
        - Compute struct size and field offsets

    *   **Struct Metadata (type_id.h):**
        ```c
        typedef struct {
            const char* name;
            StructField* fields;
            int num_fields;
            size_t size;
            size_t alignment;
            bool is_packed;
        } StructLayout;

        typedef struct {
            const char* name;
            TypeID type;
            size_t offset;
        } StructField;
        ```

    *   **Layout Computation:**
        - For each field: offset = ALIGN(current_offset, alignof(type))
        - Add sizeof(type) to current_offset
        - Final size = ALIGN(current_offset, struct_alignment)
        - Handle ^:packed: No padding between fields
        - Handle ^'align-N: Force alignment to N bytes

    *   **Code Generation:** Generate struct typedefs in output C code
        ```c
        typedef struct {
            double x;  // offset 0
            double y;  // offset 8
        } omni_Point;  // sizeof = 16
        ```

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        (define {struct ^:ffi Point}
          [x {CDouble}]
          [y {CDouble}])
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Struct layout with correct offsets (x@0, y@8, size=16)
    *   Current Behavior: Struct syntax not recognized

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t3-struct-ops-01
  Objective: Implement struct field access (deref, set!).
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:596-615, FFI_PROPOSAL.md:301-364
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c, runtime/src/runtime.c
  Why: After defining structs, we need to read and write their fields to
       actually use them in C APIs.
  What: Implement (.struct field) syntax and deref operations.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Field Access Syntax:**
        - Read: `(deref struct-value).field` or `(.- struct-value field)`
        - Write: `(set! (deref h).field value)` or `(.=- h field value)`

    *   **Code Generation (codegen.c):**
        ```c
        // For: (deref my-point).x
        // Generate:
        result = mk_double(r, my_point->x);

        // For: (set! (deref h).x 10.0)
        // Generate:
        h->x = 10.0;
        ```

    *   **Handle Structs:** When {Handle T} is dereferenced:
        ```c
        // For: (deref my-handle).field
        // Generate:
        StructT* ptr = unwrap_handle(my_handle, TYPE_ID_T);
        result = convert_to_omnilisp(ptr->field);
        ```

    *   **Bitfields:** Mark as opaque if struct contains bitfields
    *   **Unions:** Parse with (define {union ^:ffi Name} ...) syntax

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        (let [p (ffi/alloc {Point})]
          (set! (deref p).x 10.0)
          (deref p).x)
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Returns 10.0 (stored field value)
    *   Current Behavior: Field access not implemented

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t3-callback-01
  Objective: Implement callback type definitions.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:569-591, FFI_PROPOSAL.md:369-435
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, runtime/src/runtime.c
  Why: C APIs often take function pointers (callbacks) for event handling,
       comparison, async notification. Without callbacks, FFI is half-duplex only.
  What: Parse {callback Name} [params] {ReturnType} and generate trampolines.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Parser (parser.c):**
        - Recognize `(define {callback NAME} [params] {ReturnType})` pattern
        - Store callback signature for later use in extern declarations

    *   **Callback Metadata (ast.h):**
        ```c
        typedef struct {
            const char* name;
            TypeID return_type;
            ParamInfo* params;
            int num_params;
        } CallbackInfo;
        ```

    *   **Trampoline Generation (codegen.c):**
        ```c
        // For each callback type, generate a C trampoline:
        static int trampoline_Comparator(void* a, void* b) {
            // 1. Convert C params to OmniLisp values
            Obj* omni_a = c_ptr_to_omnilisp(a);
            Obj* omni_b = c_ptr_to_omnilisp(b);

            // 2. Call OmniLisp closure (stored in user_data)
            Obj* closure = (Obj*)user_data;
            Obj* result = omnilisp_call(closure, 2, (Obj*[]){omni_a, omni_b});

            // 3. Convert result back to C
            return (int)omnilisp_to_c_int(result);
        }
        ```

    *   **Closure Management:** Store closure pointer in user_data parameter
    *   **Weak Handles:** For long-lived callbacks, use WeakHandle for safety

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        (define {callback Comparator}
          [a {CPtr}] [b {CPtr}]
          {CInt})

        (define {extern qsort ^:from libc}
          [base {CPtr}] [nmemb {CSize}] [size {CSize}]
          [compar {Callback Comparator}]
          {Nothing})

        (qsort arr n (sizeof CInt)
          (fn [a {CPtr}] [b {CPtr}] {CInt}
            (- (deref {CPtr CInt} a)
               (deref {CPtr CInt} b))))
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Array sorted in ascending order
    *   Current Behavior: Callbacks not supported

### Tier 1: Inline ccall/@ccall (Quick Calls)

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t1-ccall-01
  Objective: Implement (ccall lib fn [arg {Type}]...) syntax.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:22-88
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: REPL exploration and quick tests need FFI without declaring externs.
       The "Julia-style" ccall enables calling any C function inline.
  What: Parse inline ccall and generate thunk at compile time.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Parser (parser.c):**
        - Recognize `(ccall LIBNAME FNAME [arg {Type}]... {RetType})` pattern
        - Recognize `(@ccall LIBNAME/FNAME arg...)` shorthand macro form
        - Store library symbol reference for lazy loading

    *   **Macro Expansion (for @ccall):**
        ```lisp
        ;; @ccall libc/strlen "hello"
        ;; Expands to:
        (ccall libc strlen ["hello" {CString}] {CSize})
        ```

    *   **Code Generation:**
        - Generate anonymous extern thunk at call site
        - No persistent symbol table entry needed
        - dlopen/dlsym performed at call time (cached per library)

    *   **Library Loading (runtime.c):**
        ```c
        static void* load_library(const char* name) {
            static HashTable* lib_cache = NULL;
            if (!lib_cache) lib_cache = hashtable_new();

            void* handle = hashtable_get(lib_cache, name);
            if (!handle) {
                handle = dlopen(name, RTLD_LAZY);
                hashtable_put(lib_cache, name, handle);
            }
            return handle;
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    *   Test Input (in REPL):
        ```lisp
        > (ccall libc puts ["Hello!" {CString}] {CInt})
        Hello!
        6
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Prints "Hello!" and returns 6
    *   Current Behavior: ccall syntax not recognized

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t1-ccall-02
  Objective: Implement type inference for @ccall shorthand.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:50-62
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why: The @ccall macro form should infer types from argument values when
       possible, reducing boilerplate for simple calls.
  What: Auto-infer C types from OmniLisp value types.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Type Inference Rules (analysis.c):**
        - OmniLisp Int → {CInt} or {CSize} (if result used as size)
        - OmniLisp Float → {CDouble}
        - OmniLisp String → {CString}
        - OmniLisp Bool → {CBool}
        - Explicit {Type} annotation overrides inference

    *   **Macro Expansion Pattern:**
        ```lisp
        ;; Input: (@ccall libc/puts "Hello!")
        ;; Expands to: (ccall libc puts ["Hello!" {CString}] {CInt})

        ;; Input: (@ccall libm/sin 3.14159)
        ;; Expands to: (ccall libm/sin [3.14159 {CDouble}] {CDouble})

        ;; Input: (@ccall libc/malloc 1024 {CSize})  ; explicit type
        ;; Expands to: (ccall libc/malloc [1024 {CSize}] {CPtr})
        ```

    *   **Return Type Inference:**
        - If unknown, default to {CInt}
        - Or parse optional trailing `{Type}` in @ccall

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        > (@ccall libc/puts "inferred")
        inferred
        > (@ccall libm/sin 0.0)
        0.0
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Both calls work without explicit type annotations
    *   Current Behavior: @ccall macro not implemented

### Tier 2: Header Translation (c/import)

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t2-libclang-01
  Objective: Integrate libclang for C header parsing.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:222-235
  Where: csrc/parser/, third_party/
  Why: Parsing C headers with libclang allows automatic generation of FFI bindings
       from existing C libraries. Without this, users must manually declare every function.
  What: Add libclang dependency and build infrastructure.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Dependency:**
        - Add libclang-dev to build system
        - Link with -lclang in csrc/Makefile
        - Add clang-c/Index.h include path

    *   **Build Integration (csrc/Makefile):**
        ```makefile
        # Detect libclang
        CFLAGS += $(shell llvm-config --cflags)
        LDFLAGS += $(shell llvm-config --libs clang)
        ```

    *   **Fallback if libclang not found:**
        - Tier 2 becomes optional (document as requires libclang)
        - Tier 1 and Tier 3 still work without libclang

  Verification:
    *   Test Input: Build with libclang present
    *   Expected Output: clang-c/Index.h found, libclang links successfully
    *   Current Behavior: No libclang integration

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t2-translate-01
  Objective: Implement (c/import "<header.h>") syntax.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:157-210
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/parser/translate_c.c
  Why: Users should be able to import C headers directly and get auto-generated
       OmniLisp bindings. This is the "Zig-style" approach.
  What: Parse c/import and use libclang to generate extern declarations.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Parser (parser.c):**
        - Recognize `(c/import "<header.h>")` pattern
        - Recognize `(define lib (c/import "<header.h>"))` form
        - Parse optional `^:only [sym1 sym2...]` to filter symbols
        - Parse optional `^:defines [KEY VAL]...` for preprocessor defines

    *   **Translation Unit (translate_c.c):**
        ```c
        typedef struct {
            const char* header_path;
            Symbol** filter_symbols;    // NULL = import all
            int num_filters;
            KeyValue* defines;          // Preprocessor defines
            int num_defines;
        } ImportConfig;

        // Parse header with libclang
        OmniExternDecl* translate_header(ImportConfig* config, int* num_decls);
        ```

    *   **libclang Integration:**
        ```c
        CXIndex index = clang_createIndex(0, 0);
        CXTranslationUnit unit = clang_parseTranslationUnit(
            index,
            config->header_path,
            /* args */ clang_args,
            /* num_args */ num_args,
            /* unsaved_files */ NULL,
            /* num_unsaved_files */ 0,
            CXTranslationUnit_None
        );

        // Iterate through declarations
        CXCursor cursor = clang_getTranslationUnitCursor(unit);
        clang_visitChildren(cursor, visit_function, &context);
        ```

    *   **Symbol Filtering:** Only export functions/types in filter list (if provided)
    *   **Name Mangling:** Strip leading underscores if present

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        (define stdio (c/import "<stdio.h>" ^'only [printf puts]))
        (printf "Imported!\n")
        ```
    *   Expected Output: printf and puts available as OmniLisp functions
    *   Current Behavior: c/import not recognized

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t2-translate-02
  Objective: Implement command-line translate-c tool.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:183-210
  Where: csrc/cli/main.c
  Why: Users should be able to pre-generate binding files (.omni) from headers
       for faster compilation and version control.
  What: Add `omnilisp translate-c <header> -o <output.omni>` command.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **CLI Integration (main.c):**
        ```c
        if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "translate-c") == 0) {
            if (argc < 4) {
                fprintf(stderr, "Usage: omnilisp translate-c <header> -o <output>\n");
                return 1;

          ...)
        ```

    *   **Macro Handling:** Try to evaluate constant macros, otherwise fail gracefully
    *   **Struct Layout:** Emit struct definitions with computed field offsets

  Verification:
    *   Test Input: `omnilisp translate-c /usr/include/stdio.h -o stdio.omni`
    *   Expected Output: Generates stdio.omni with extern declarations for printf, etc.
    *   Current Behavior: No translate-c command exists

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-t2-harden-01
  Objective: Implement ffi harden tool for Tier 3 generation.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:419-429
  Where: csrc/cli/main.c
  Why: Auto-generated bindings (Tier 2) lack ownership annotations. Users should
       be able to generate a "Tier 3 skeleton" with ownership annotations to fill in.
  What: Add `omnilisp ffi harden <input.omni> -o <output.omni>` command.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```bash
        omnilisp ffi harden lib/sdl2.omni -o lib/sdl2-safe.omni
        ```

    *   **Transformation Rules:**
        - Change all {CPtr T} returns to {^'owned (Handle T)} with TODO comment
        - Add `^'destructor ???` TODO comments for Handle types
        - Mark pointer params as `^:borrowed` by default
        - Add `^:may-fail` TODO comments for functions returning error codes

    *   **Output Format:**
        ```lisp
        ;; Input: (define {extern SDL_Init} [flags {CUInt32}] {CInt})

          {CInt})  ; TODO: Change to {Result CInt CInt} if may-fail
        ```

    *   **Documentation Generation:** Add comments with original C signature

  Verification:
    *   Test Input: `omnilisp ffi harden stdio.omni -o stdio-safe.omni`

    *   Current Behavior: No harden command exists

### FFI Runtime & Testing

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-runtime-ffi-alloc-01
  Objective: Implement ffi/alloc primitive for FFI-managed memory.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:596-615
  Where: runtime/src/runtime.c
  Why: FFI often requires allocating memory that C will manage (or vice versa).
       The ffi/alloc primitive allocates memory in a region compatible with C.
  What: Add prim_ffi_alloc that returns {CPtr} for FFI use.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Function Signature:**
        ```c
        Obj* prim_ffi_alloc(Region* r, Obj* type, Obj* size_obj);
        ```

    *   **Implementation:**
        ```c
        Obj* prim_ffi_alloc(Region* r, Obj* type, Obj* size_obj) {
            // type is a Kind object like {Point} or {Array CInt 10}
            TypeID type_id = get_type_id(type);
            const TypeMetadata* meta = type_metadata_get(r, type_id);

            // Allocate memory for the type
            void* ptr = region_alloc(r, meta->size, meta->alignment);

            // Return as handle (not raw pointer - for safety)
            uint64_t handle = wrap_external_handle(ptr, type_id, r);
            return mk_uint64(r, handle);
        }
        ```

    *   **Zero Initialization:** Initialize allocated memory to zeros
    *   **Alignment:** Use type's metadata alignment for proper struct layout

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        (let [h (ffi/alloc {Point})]
          (set! (deref h).x 10.0)
          (deref h).x)
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Returns 10.0
    *   Current Behavior: prim_ffi_alloc not implemented

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-runtime-ffi-free-01
  Objective: Implement ffi/free primitive for explicit cleanup.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:596-615
  Where: runtime/src/runtime.c
  Why: Memory allocated with ffi/alloc must be freed when no longer needed.
       This integrates with ASAP for automatic free insertion.
  What: Add prim_ffi_free that releases FFI-managed memory.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Function Signature:**
        ```c
        Obj* prim_ffi_free(Region* r, Obj* handle_obj);
        ```

    *   **Implementation:**
        ```c
        Obj* prim_ffi_free(Region* r, Obj* handle_obj) {
            uint64_t handle_val = handle_obj->u64;
            void* ptr = unwrap_external_handle(handle_val, NULL);  // Any type OK

            if (ptr) {
                // Mark handle as invalid (increment generation)
                invalidate_external_handle(handle_val);

                // Free the underlying memory
                free(ptr);  // Or region_dealloc if allocated in region
            }

            return NOTHING;
        }
        ```

    *   **Handle Invalidation:** Must update generation counter to catch use-after-free
    *   **ASAP Integration:** CLEAN phase inserts free at end of scope or last use

  Verification:
    *   Test Input:
        ```lisp
        (let [h (ffi/alloc {CInt})]
          (set! (deref h) 42)
          (ffi/free h)
          (deref h))  ; Should error - use after free
        ```
    *   Expected Output: Runtime error on second deref (handle invalidated)
    *   Current Behavior: prim_ffi_free not implemented

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-test-stdlib-01
  Objective: Create comprehensive FFI tests using C standard library.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:546-718
  Where: tests/ffi/, examples/ffi/
  Why: The C standard library is available everywhere and provides a good test
       surface for FFI (strings, file I/O, math, memory allocation).
  What: Write test suite covering all FFI features using libc functions.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Test File Structure:**
        ```
        tests/ffi/
          test_ffi_primitives.omni   - Test ccall with simple functions
          test_ffi_structs.omni      - Test struct passing/receiving

            ;; This should error (use-after-free)
            (assert-error (deref h)))
          ```

  Verification:
    *   Test Input: `./omnilisp tests/ffi/test_ffi_primitives.omni`
    *   Expected Output: All FFI tests pass
    *   Current Behavior: No FFI tests exist

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-example-sdl2-01
  Objective: Create SDL2 binding example demonstrating full FFI.
  Reference: docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md:619-718
  Where: examples/ffi/sdl2/
  Why: SDL2 is a real-world C library that demonstrates all FFI features:
       opaque types, structs, callbacks, ownership, handles. A working example
       validates the entire FFI design.
  What: Implement complete SDL2 bindings and example program.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Tier 2 Auto-Generated (sdl2_auto.omni):**
        ```bash
        omnilisp translate-c /usr/include/SDL2/SDL.h -o sdl2_auto.omni
        ```

    *   **Tier 3 Hand-Crafted (sdl2_safe.omni):**
        - Run `omnilisp ffi harden sdl2_auto.omni -o sdl2_safe.omni`
        - Fill in ownership annotations:
        ```lisp
        (define {opaque SDL_Window ^'destructor SDL_DestroyWindow})
        (define {opaque SDL_Renderer ^:destructor SDL_DestroyRenderer})

        (define {extern SDL_CreateWindow ^:from "libSDL2.so"}
          [^:borrowed title {CString}]
          [x {CInt}] [y {CInt}]
          [w {CInt}] [h {CInt}]
          [flags {CUInt32}]
          {^:owned (Handle SDL_Window)})
        ```

    *   **High-Level API (sdl2.omni):**
        ```lisp
        (define (with-sdl body)
          (SDL_Init SDL_INIT_VIDEO)
          (try
            (body)
            (finally (SDL_Quit))))

            (try
              (body win)
              (finally nil))))  ; Handle auto-freed via destructor
        ```

    *   **Example Program (demo.omni):**
        ```lisp
        (import SDL2)

        (with-sdl
          (with-window "Hello OmniLisp FFI!" 800 600
            (fn [win]

        ```

  Verification:
    *   Test Input: `./omnilisp examples/ffi/sdl2/demo.omni`
    *   Expected Output: Window opens, displays blue screen for 2 seconds, closes cleanly
    *   Current Behavior: No SDL2 example exists

- [TODO] Label: T-ffi-docs-integration-01
  Objective: Update language documentation with FFI syntax.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX.md, docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md
  Where: docs/SYNTAX.md
  Why: The FFI design proposals are comprehensive but need to be integrated
       into the main language syntax documentation for users.
  What: Add FFI section to SYNTAX.md with all three tiers.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Add new section to docs/SYNTAX.md:**
        ```markdown
        ## Foreign Function Interface (FFI)

        OmniLisp provides a three-tiered FFI system:

        ### Tier 1: Inline ccall (Quick Exploration)

        ### Tier 2: Header Import (Bulk Bindings)

        ### Tier 3: Extern Declarations (Production Safety)
        ```

    *   **Cross-Reference:** Link to docs/FFI_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md for details
    *   **Examples:** Include working examples for each tier
    *   **Cheat Sheet:** Quick reference table of common patterns

  Verification:
    *   Test Input: Check that docs/SYNTAX.md has FFI section
    *   Expected Output: FFI section exists with syntax examples
    *   Current Behavior: No FFI documentation in SYNTAX.md

## Phase 22: Language Reference Alignment [ACTIVE]

**Objective:** Implement remaining features from `docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md` and `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` to achieve full parity with the language specification.

**Context:** The language reference defines OmniLisp syntax using the Character Calculus rules (`[]` = Slot, `{}` = Kind, `()` = Flow, `^` = Metadata). Several features documented in the reference are not yet wired in the compiler/runtime.

### 22.1 Type Definitions (Julia-Style)

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-type-abstract
  Objective: Implement abstract type definitions with metadata.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 3.1
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/analysis/analysis.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: Abstract types form the base of Julia-style type hierarchy.
  What: Parse and analyze `(define ^:parent {Any} {abstract Number} [])`.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser (parser.c):**
      - Extend `analyze_define` to detect `{abstract ...}` as first argument
      - Check for OMNI_TYPE_LIT with type_name == "abstract"
      - Extract parent from ^:parent metadata (if present)
      - Create TypeDef with is_abstract = true
    
    * **Analyzer (analysis.c):**
      - Add `omni_register_abstract_type(char* name, char* parent)`
      - Store in TypeRegistry with is_abstract flag set
      - Validate: no fields allowed for abstract types
      - Validate: parent must exist or be "Any"
    
    * **Codegen (codegen.c):**
      - Emit C typedef or forward declaration
      - For abstract types: `typedef struct TypeAbstract TypeAbstract;`
      - No field layout needed (no instance creation)
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(define ^:parent {Any} {abstract Number} [])`
    - Expected: TypeDef registered with name="Number", parent="Any", is_abstract=true
    - Test: `(type? (Number) Int)` returns false (Int is not abstract)

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-type-primitive
  Objective: Implement primitive type definitions with bit width.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 3.2
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/analysis/analysis.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: Primitive types map directly to C machine types.
  What: Parse and analyze `(define ^:parent {Real} {primitive Float64} [64])`.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser (parser.c):**
      - Detect `{primitive ...}` pattern in define
      - Extract type name from type literal (e.g., "Float64")
      - Extract bit width from Slot array parameter (e.g., [64])
    
    * **Analyzer (analysis.c):**
      - Add `omni_register_primitive_type(char* name, char* parent, int bit_width)`
      - Store bit_width in TypeDef
      - Map bit widths to C types:
        - 32 -> int32_t, float
        - 64 -> int64_t, double
      - Validate: no fields allowed (primitives are opaque)
    
    * **Codegen (codegen.c):**
      - Emit C typedef based on bit_width
      - Example: `typedef double TypeFloat64;` or `typedef int64_t TypeInt64;`
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(define ^:parent {Real} {primitive Float64} [64])`
    - Expected: TypeDef with name="Float64", parent="Real", bit_width=64, is_primitive=true
    - Generated C: `typedef double TypeFloat64;`

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-type-struct
  Objective: Implement composite type definitions (structs).
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 3.3
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/analysis/analysis.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: Structs are the primary user-defined composite type.
  What: Parse and analyze `(define ^:parent {Any} {struct Point} [x {Float64}] [y {Float64}])`.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser (parser.c):**
      - Detect `{struct ...}` pattern in define
      - Extract struct name from type literal
      - Parse field slots: `[name {Type}?]`
      - Extract field names and optional type annotations
    
    * **Analyzer (analysis.c):**
      - Add `omni_register_struct_type(char* name, TypeField* fields, size_t count)`
      - Store fields in TypeDef
      - For each field: extract name, type_name, is_mutable, variance
      - Validate: at least one field required
      - Validate: no cycles in field type references (or mark as has_cycles=true)
    
    * **Codegen (codegen.c):**
      - Emit C struct definition:
        ```c
        typedef struct TypePoint {
            OmniValue* x;  // Float64
            OmniValue* y;  // Float64
        } TypePoint;
        ```
      - Include field types as comments for documentation
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(define ^:parent {Any} {struct Point} [x {Float64}] [y {Float64}])`
    - Expected: TypeDef with name="Point", fields=[{name="x", type_name="Float64"}, {name="y", type_name="Float64"}]
    - Generated C: struct with two OmniValue* fields

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-type-parametric
  Objective: Implement parametric types with variance annotations.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 3.4
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why: Parametric types enable generic containers (List, Vector, etc.).
  What: Parse and analyze `(define {struct [^:covar T]} {List} [head {T}] [tail {List T}])`.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser (parser.c):**
      - Detect metadata ^:covar or ^:contra in struct parameters
      - Extract type parameter name (e.g., "T")
      - Extract variance from metadata
    
    * **Analyzer (analysis.c):**
      - Add `omni_register_parametric_type(char* name, char** type_params, VarianceKind* variances)`
      - Store type_params and variance info in TypeDef
      - For fields with parametric types {T}, store as type_name="T"
      - Track variance per parameter for later subtype checking
    
    * **Variance checking (future task):**
      - Use variance in omni_type_is_subtype for parametric types
      - Example: (List Int) ⊑ (List Any) because List is covariant
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(define {struct [^:covar T]} {List} [head {T}] [tail {List T}])`
    - Expected: TypeDef with type_params=["T"], variances=[VARIANCE_COVARIANT]

### 22.2 Metadata Attachment

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-metadata-attach-define
  Objective: Attach metadata to definitions during parsing.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 5
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/ast/ast.c
  Why: Metadata (^:parent, ^:where, etc.) modifies definition behavior.
  What: Extract metadata from define forms and attach to AST nodes.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Current state:**
      - Parser has `act_metadata` that parses `^ key value` forms
      - Returns a list (meta-keyword obj) but doesn't attach it
    
    * **Problem:**
      - Metadata appears BEFORE the definition it modifies
      - Example: `^:parent {Number} (define {abstract Int} [])`
      - Current parser treats metadata as separate expression
    
    * **Solution:**
      - Modify `act_metadata` to look ahead for following define/lambda
      - Attach metadata to the following definition's AST node
      - Or: Parse metadata as part of define form (prefix metadata)
    
    * **Implementation:**
      - In parser.c, modify grammar to allow metadata prefix:
        ```
        DEFINE_WITH_META = METADATA* DEFINE
        ```
      - In `act_define_with_meta`, collect all metadata entries
      - Attach to OmniValue->metadata (new field in OmniValue struct)
      - Pass metadata to analyzer as part of the definition
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `^:parent {Number} (define {abstract Int} [])`
    - Expected: AST node for abstract Int has metadata entry {META_PARENT, value={Number}}
    - Test: `omni_get_metadata(define_ast, "parent")` returns {Number}

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-metadata-where
  Objective: Implement ^:where constraints for diagonal dispatch.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 2.2
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why: ^:where enforces that multiple arguments share the same type.
  What: Parse and analyze `(define ^:where [T {Number}] [x {T}] [y {T}] {T} (+ x y))`.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser:**
      - Extract ^:where metadata from define
      - Parse constraint list: `[T {Number}]` means "T is subtype of Number"
    
    * **Analyzer:**
      - Add `omni_check_where_constraints(ParamSummary* params, MetadataEntry* where_meta)`
      - For each constraint `[T {UpperBound}]`:
        - Collect all parameters with type annotation {T}
        - Verify they have the same concrete type
        - Verify that type is a subtype of {UpperBound}
      - Emit error if constraints are violated
    
    * **Dispatch integration:**
      - Use ^:where constraints in generic function lookup
      - Only select methods where all constraints are satisfied
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(define ^:where [T {Number}] [x {T}] [y {T}] {T} (+ x y))`
    - Call: `(add-generic 1 2)` - should match (both Int, Int ⊑ Number)
    - Call: `(add-generic "a" "b")` - should error (String not ⊑ Number)

### 22.3 Lambda Syntax Variants

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-lambda-fn
  Objective: Implement `fn` as lambda shorthand.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 2.3
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c, csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why: `fn` is more ergonomic than `lambda` and aligns with modern Lisps.
  What: Parse `(fn [x] (* x x))` as equivalent to `(lambda [x] (* x x))`.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser (parser.c):**
      - Detect "fn" as list head in parser
      - Treat identically to "lambda" keyword
      - No grammar changes needed (just symbol check)
    
    * **Analyzer (analysis.c):**
      - In `analyze_lambda`, already handles lambda
      - Just ensure "fn" is recognized as lambda synonym
      - Search for `strcmp(name, "lambda")` and add `|| strcmp(name, "fn") == 0`
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(fn [x] (* x x))`
    - Expected: Same AST as `(lambda [x] (* x x))`
    - Call: `((fn [x] (* x x)) 5)` => 25

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-lambda-lambda
  Objective: Implement `λ` (Greek letter) as lambda shorthand.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 2.3
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c
  Why: Mathematical notation, even more concise.
  What: Parse `(λ [x] (* x x))` as lambda.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser (parser.c):**
      - Ensure UTF-8 support for λ (U+03BB)
      - In symbol reader, recognize λ as valid symbol character
      - In analyzer, treat λ as lambda synonym (like `fn`)
    
    * **Note:**
      - May require reader encoding verification
      - Test with UTF-8 source files
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(λ [x] (* x x))`
    - Expected: Same AST as `(lambda [x] (* x x))`

### 22.4 Match Expression

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-match-parse
  Objective: Implement match expression parsing.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 6.1
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c
  Why: Pattern matching is fundamental for destructuring and control flow.
  What: Parse `(match val [pattern result] [pattern :when guard result] [else default])`.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser (parser.c):**
      - Add grammar rule for MATCH:
        ```
        MATCH = "match" WS EXPR WS MATCH_CLAUSE+
        MATCH_CLAUSE = "[" WS EXPR WS (":when" WS EXPR WS)? EXPR "]"
        ```
      - Distinguish patterns from expressions:
        - Patterns: symbols (variables), literals (42, "foo"), arrays `[x y]`, lists `(cons a b)`
        - Results: arbitrary expressions
    
    * **AST representation:**
      - Create OMNI_MATCH tag in ast.h
      - Store: value_expr, clauses array
      - Each clause: pattern, guard (optional), result_expr
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(match 1 [1 "one"] [2 "two"] [_ "other"])`
    - Expected: AST with OMNI_MATCH tag, 3 clauses

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-match-analyze
  Objective: Implement match expression analysis.
  Reference: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why: Need to track variable bindings and liveness in match patterns.
  What: Analyze variable scope and usage in match clauses.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Analyzer (analysis.c):**
      - Add `analyze_match(AnalysisContext* ctx, OmniValue* expr)`
      - Analyze value_expr first
      - For each clause:
        - Extract variable bindings from pattern
        - Create new scope for pattern variables
        - Mark variable writes for pattern bindings
        - Analyze guard (if present)
        - Analyze result_expr
        - Track last-use for cleanup
      - Handle wildcards `_` (no binding)
    
    * **Pattern variable extraction:**
      - Symbols in patterns are variable bindings
      - Literals (int, string) are not bindings
      - Nested patterns: `[x y]` binds x and y
      - Constructor patterns: `(Cons h t)` binds h and t
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(match [1 2] [[x y] (+ x y)] [_ 0])`
    - Expected: Variables x and y marked as written, used in (+ x y)
    - Liveness: x and y can be freed after (+ x y)

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-match-codegen
  Objective: Implement match expression code generation.
  Reference: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: Generate efficient C code for pattern matching.
  What: Emit if-else chain or switch for match clauses.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Codegen (codegen.c):**
      - Add `codegen_match(CodegenContext* ctx, OmniValue* expr)`
      - Generate if-else chain:
        ```c
        // Simple strategy: linear search
        if (match_clause1(value)) { return result1; }
        else if (match_clause2(value)) { return result2; }
        else { return default_result; }
        ```
      - For integer literals: use switch statement for efficiency
      - For type patterns: use tag checking
    
    * **Pattern matching runtime:**
      - Need helper functions for each pattern type
      - `match_int(value, target)` - compare integers
      - `match_cons(value)` - check if cons cell
      - `match_array(value, expected_len)` - check array length
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(match x [42 "answer"] [_ "other"])`
    - Generated C:
      ```c
      if (omni_is_int(x) && omni_int_val(x) == 42) {
          return omni_new_string("answer");
      } else {
          return omni_new_string("other");
      }
      ```

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-match-guards
  Objective: Implement :when guards in match clauses.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 6.1
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: Guards enable conditional pattern matching.
  What: Generate guard checks before executing clause body.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Codegen:**
      - For clauses with `:when guard`, emit guard check
      - Only execute result if guard evaluates to true
      - Fall through to next clause if guard fails
    
    * **Generated C pattern:**
      ```c
      // [pattern :when guard result]
      if (matches_pattern(value)) {
          if (eval_guard(value)) {  // guard expression
              return result_expr;
          }
      } else {
          // next clause
      }
      ```
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(match n [{Int} :when (> n 0) "positive"] [_ "non-positive"])`
    - Expected: Guard `n > 0` checked before returning "positive"

### 22.5 Let Variants

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-let-seq
  Objective: Implement ^:seq metadata for sequential let (let*).
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 6.2
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: let* allows each binding to see previous bindings (useful for computation chains).
  What: Parse and analyze `(let ^:seq [x 1] [y (+ x 1)] y)`.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser:**
      - Detect ^:seq metadata on let form
      - Pass to analyzer as metadata flag
    
    * **Analyzer:**
      - In `analyze_let`, check for META_SEQ metadata
      - If ^:seq present:
        - Create nested scopes (each binding in separate scope)
        - Each binding sees previous bindings
        - Equivalent to expanding to nested lets:
          ```
          (let [x 1]
            (let [y (+ x 1)]
              y))
          ```
      - If no ^:seq:
        - All bindings in same scope (parallel let)
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(let ^:seq [x 1] [y (+ x 1)] y)` => 2
    - Input: `(let [x 1] [y (+ x 1)] y)` => error (x not visible in y's init)

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-let-rec
  Objective: Implement ^:rec metadata for recursive let (letrec).
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 6.2
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: letrec enables mutually recursive definitions.
  What: Parse and analyze `(let ^:rec [is-even (fn [n] (if (= n 0) true (is-odd (- n 1)))) ...)`).
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Analyzer:**
      - In `analyze_let`, check for META_REC metadata
      - If ^:rec present:
        - Create placeholder bindings first (uninitialized)
        - Then analyze init expressions (can reference placeholders)
        - Mark all bindings as mutually recursive
      - Escape analysis:
        - Recursive bindings escape (can't be stack-allocated)
        - Disable inlining for recursive functions
    
    * **Codegen:**
      - Generate forward declarations for all bindings
      - Then initialize in sequence
      - For closures: fix up references to recursive functions
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(let ^:rec [is-even (fn [n] ...)] [is-odd (fn [n] ...)] (is-even 5))`
    - Expected: is-even can call is-odd and vice versa

### 22.6 Union Types

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-union-parse
  Objective: Implement union type parsing.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 4.1
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c
  Why: Union types enable expressing "either A or B" types.
  What: Parse `(union [{Int32} {String}])` as type constructor.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser:**
      - Detect "union" symbol in type position
      - Parse as Flow constructor: `(union [type1 type2 ...])`
      - Return as OMNI_TYPE_LIT with type_name="union" and params=[type1, type2, ...]
    
    * **Type representation:**
      - Store union as special TypeDef
      - Or: Store as type reference to built-in Union type
      - Track member types in type_params array
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(define {IntOrString} (union [{Int32} {String}]))`
    - Expected: TypeDef with name="IntOrString", kind=UNION, members=[Int32, String]

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-union-subtype
  Objective: Implement union type subtype checking.
  Reference: docs/TYPE_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md (Open Questions section)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why: Need to check if a type is a member of a union.
  What: Update `omni_type_is_subtype` to handle unions.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Subtype rule:**
      - T ⊑ (union A B C) iff T ⊑ A OR T ⊑ B OR T ⊑ C
      - In other words: T is a subtype of union if T is subtype of ANY member
    
    * **Implementation:**
      - In `omni_type_is_subtype`:
        - If type_b is a union:
          - Check if type_a is subtype of any union member
          - Return true if any match
      - If type_a is a union:
        - Not directly supported (union as argument)
        - Would require union type dispatch
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `omni_type_is_subtype("Int", "IntOrString")` where IntOrString = (union Int String)
    - Expected: true (Int is member of union)

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-union-dispatch
  Objective: Implement dispatch on union types.
  Reference: docs/TYPE_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md Section "Open Questions"
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c, runtime/src/generic.c
  Why: Multiple dispatch over union types needs special handling.
  What: Select method when argument type is a union.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Dispatch strategy:**
      - When argument is a union value:
        - Check actual runtime type of value
        - Use that type for method selection
        - Not the union type itself
    
    * **Alternative:**
      - Treat union as "any of these types"
      - Method selection based on most specific member type
      - Example: For (union Int String), prefer Int method over Any method
  
  Verification:
    - Input: Define methods for Int, String, Any. Call with union value containing Int.
    - Expected: Int method selected (based on actual value type)

### 22.7 Function Types

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-fn-type-parse
  Objective: Implement function type parsing.
  Reference: docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md Section 4.2
  Where: csrc/parser/parser.c
  Why: Function types enable higher-order functions with type annotations.
  What: Parse `(fn [[{Int32}] {Int32}])` as function type.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **Parser:**
      - Detect "fn" in type position (inside `{}`)
      - Parse as: `(fn [[params] {return}])`
      - Return as OMNI_TYPE_LIT with type_name="fn" and special structure
    
    * **Type representation:**
      - Store as FunctionType struct (add to analysis.h)
      - Fields: param_types (array), return_type
  
  Verification:
    - Input: `(define [f {(fn [{Int32}] {Int32})}] ...)`
    - Expected: Parameter f has function type (Int32 -> Int32)

### 22.8 Documentation Updates

- [TODO] Label: T-ref-docs-status
  Objective: Update documentation to reflect implementation status.
  Reference: docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md, docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md
  Where: docs/
  Why: Users need to know which features are actually implemented.
  What: Add implementation status markers to documentation.
  
  Implementation Details:
    * **For each feature in QUICK_REFERENCE.md:**
      - Add [IMPLEMENTED] or [DESIGN TARGET] marker
      - Update based on Phase 22 completion status
    
    * **Create implementation tracking:**
      - Table mapping feature -> task label
      - Update as tasks are completed
  
  Verification:
    - docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md has status for each major feature
    - Status matches actual implementation (test by trying examples)
