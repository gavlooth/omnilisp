# OmniLisp TODO

## Review Directive

**All newly implemented features must be marked with `[R]` (Review Needed) until explicitly approved by the user.**

- When an agent completes implementing a feature, mark it `[R]` (not `[DONE]`)
- `[R]` means: code is written and working, but awaits user review/approval
- After user approval, change `[R]` to `[DONE]`
- Workflow: `[TODO]` → implement → `[R]` → user approves → `[DONE]`

---

## Jujutsu Commit Directive (MANDATORY)

**Use Jujutsu (jj) for ALL version control operations.**

### Pre-Task Checklist (MANDATORY)

**Before beginning ANY implementation subtask, you MUST:**

1. **Run `jj describe`** to see the current working state
2. **Read the description** to understand what changes are in progress
3. **Confirm alignment** with the task you're about to implement
4. **If mismatch**: Either `jj squash` to consolidate or `jj new` to start fresh

```bash
# ALWAYS run this first
jj describe

# Example output:
# "Add region metadata type structures
#
# Working on:
# - Define TypeMetadata struct
# - Modify Region to include type_table
# - Update Obj to use type_id"
#
# If this matches your task, proceed. If not, resolve mismatch first.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents working on stale/abandoned changes
- Ensures atomic, focused commits
- Makes `jj squash` meaningful (one semantic change per description)
- Enables clean history with descriptive commits

### Commit Workflow

- **Use jj (not git)**: All commits must be made using `jj` commands
- **Squash workflow**: Use `jj squash` to combine related changes before committing
- **Immutable history**: JJ's model ensures the state hash is always a true hash
- **For every completed task:**
  - Create a dedicated jujutsu squash with a clear, imperative message (e.g., `Add effect handler core`)
  - Use `jj squash` to consolidate related changes
  - Use `jj commit` with descriptive messages following conventional commit format
  - Mark task as `[R]` in TODO.md after committing

**Why Jujutsu:**
- Immutable, reproducible state hashes
- Better branchless workflow
- Automatic change tracking
- Safer operations with easy undo via `jj undo`

**Basic workflow:**
```bash
jj status                    # Check status
jj squash                    # Combine staged changes
jj commit -m "feat: Add X"   # Commit changes
jj undo                      # Undo if needed
```

  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_pointer.h
  What: Zero-cost pointer encoding using high 16 bits for region ID.
  Verification: **ACHIEVED zero-cost encoding!** Benchmark results (2025-01-08):
  - Encoding: ~0.00 ns/op (bitwise OR + shift)
  - Decoding: ~0.00 ns/op (bitwise AND)
  - Total: ~0.00 ns/op (essentially free)
  - Capacity: 65,536 regions × 32 TB each
  - All 9 test suites passed
  See: docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS_POINTER_MASKING.md

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-compiler
  Objective: Extend type checker to emit type_id constants.
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  What: Replace TAG constants with compile-time TypeID constants.
  How: Add type_id tracking to VarUsage struct, emit in codegen.

  Implementation (2026-01-08):
  - Created csrc/analysis/type_id.h with TypeID enum matching runtime
  - Created csrc/analysis/type_id.c with type name to TypeID mapping
  - Added type_id field to VarUsage struct (analysis.h:43)
  - Added omni_get_var_type_id() and omni_set_var_type_id() functions
  - Integrated type_id assignment in reuse analysis pass (analysis.c:1157-1178)
  - Variables now track compile-time type constants (TYPE_ID_INT, TYPE_ID_PAIR, etc.)

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-codegen
  Objective: Generate calls to alloc_obj_typed() in codegen.
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  What: Replace alloc_obj_region() calls with alloc_obj_typed().
  How: Use type_id from analysis instead of tag.

  Implementation (2026-01-08):
  - Added omni_codegen_emit_typed_alloc() to emit alloc_obj_typed() calls (codegen.h:178-181)
  - Added omni_codegen_get_var_type_id() to query type_id from analysis (codegen.h:189)
  - Updated let expression codegen to use typed allocation (codegen.c:3215-3243)
  - Falls back to region_alloc() for unknown types (TYPE_ID_GENERIC)
  - Type information flows: analysis → type_id → codegen

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-escape-alloc
  Objective: Implement escape-driven inline allocation.
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  What: Use escape analysis to determine inline allocation candidates.
  How: Check escape status and use inline threshold from metadata.

  Implementation (2026-01-08):
  - Added type_id_can_inline() to query inline capability (type_id.h:107)
  - Added type_id_inline_threshold() to get inline threshold (type_id.h:122)
  - Compile-time metadata tables mirror runtime TypeMetadata values
  - Enhanced codegen to document allocation strategy in comments (codegen.c:3230-3256)
  - Escape-driven allocation: non-escaping → stack, escaping → typed with inline

  Allocation Strategy:
  1. Non-escaping (ESCAPE_TARGET_NONE): Stack allocation
  2. Escaping + typed: alloc_obj_typed() with inline metadata
  3. Escaping + unknown: Generic region_alloc()

  Inline Allocation Types:
  - can_inline=true: INT, FLOAT, CHAR, PAIR, SYMBOL, BOX, ERROR, ATOM, TUPLE, NAMED_TUPLE, NOTHING
  - can_inline=false: ARRAY, STRING, DICT, CLOSURE, CHANNEL, THREAD, GENERIC, KIND
  - Thresholds: 8 bytes (CHAR/NOTHING) to 64 bytes (NAMED_TUPLE)

  Runtime Integration:
  - region_alloc_typed() automatically uses inline buffer based on metadata
  - Constructors (mk_int, mk_pair, etc.) use alloc_obj_typed()
  - Inline allocation happens transparently through existing code paths

---

## Phase 25: Wire Type Metadata to Compiler [ACTIVE]

**Objective:** Connect the Phase 24 type_id infrastructure to the actual compiler codegen so it generates `alloc_obj_typed()` calls directly.

**Why:** Currently the compiler generates calls to constructor functions (mk_int, mk_pair, etc.) which internally use alloc_obj_typed(). We want the compiler to emit `alloc_obj_typed()` directly to eliminate the indirection.

**Reference:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Clarified Terminology section)

- [R] Label: T-opt-compiler-type-inference-integration
  Objective: Integrate type_id assignment into type inference pass.
  Reference: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (current type inference)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  What: Assign type_id to variables during type inference, not just in reuse analysis.
  How:
    - Find where type inference assigns types to variables
    - Add type_id assignment alongside type assignment
    - Use type_name_to_type_id() to map inferred type to TypeID enum
    - Store in VarUsage->type_id field (already added)

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Locate type inference code:**
        - Search for where `alloc_type` or `reuse_candidate->type` is set
        - This is where type names are inferred (e.g., "Int", "Pair")
        - Currently only in reuse analysis pass

    *   **Add type_id assignment:**
        ```c
        // When type is inferred:
        const char* type_name = infer_type(expr);
        TypeID type_id = type_name_to_type_id(type_name);
        omni_set_var_type_id(ctx, var_name, type_id);
        ```

    *   **Cover more expression types:**
        - Currently only handles: cons, mk-int, mk-float
        - Need to add: array, string, symbol, dict, closure, etc.
        - See type_id.c for full mapping (19 types)

  Verification:
    - Test: Type inference assigns type_id correctly for all 19 core types
    - Test: Variables in let bindings have type_id set
    - Test: Unknown types default to TYPE_ID_GENERIC

- [R] Label: T-opt-compiler-codegen-direct-typed-alloc
  Objective: Generate alloc_obj_typed() calls instead of constructor functions.
  Reference: csrc/codegen/codegen.c (current code generation)
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  What: Replace mk_int(), mk_pair(), etc. with alloc_obj_typed() calls.
  How:
    - Find where codegen emits constructor calls
    - Replace with alloc_obj_typed() + field initialization
    - Use type_id from analysis (omni_get_var_type_id())
    - Emit type_id constant directly in generated code

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Find constructor generation sites:**
        - Search for `mk_int`, `mk_pair`, `prim_cons` in codegen.c
        - These are currently emitted as function calls

    *   **Generate direct allocation:**
        ```c
        // Instead of:
        Obj* x = mk_int(42);

        // Generate:
        Obj* x = alloc_obj_typed(_local_region, TYPE_ID_INT);
        x->tag = TAG_INT;
        x->int_val = 42;
        ```

    *   **Handle complex constructors:**
        - Pairs need allocation + car/cdr initialization
        - Arrays need size + element initialization
        - Closures need capture list initialization

  Verification:
    - Test: Generated code uses alloc_obj_typed() for integers
    - Test: Generated code uses alloc_obj_typed() for pairs
    - Test: Generated code compiles and runs correctly
    - Benchmark: Compare performance (should be same or slightly faster)

- [R] Label: T-opt-compiler-escape-driven-allocation
  Objective: Integrate escape analysis with inline allocation decisions.
  Reference: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (escape analysis), csrc/codegen/codegen.c (codegen)
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  What: Use escape status to choose between stack/inline/arena allocation.
  How:
    - Check escape status before generating allocation
    - Non-escaping: stack allocate (current behavior)
    - Escaping + typed: use alloc_obj_typed() (uses inline when appropriate)
    - Escaping + unknown: use region_alloc() (fallback)

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Current escape-driven allocation:**
        - Already in codegen.c:3210-3257
        - Non-escaping → stack allocation
        - Escaping → typed or arena allocation

    *   **Add inline allocation hints:**
        ```c
        if (escape == ESCAPE_TARGET_NONE) {
            // Stack allocate (already done)
        } else {
            int type_id = omni_get_var_type_id(ctx, var_name);
            if (type_id != TYPE_ID_GENERIC) {
                bool can_inline = type_id_can_inline(type_id);
                // Emit comment about inline capability
            }
            alloc_obj_typed(region, type_id);
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Test: Non-escaping variables use stack allocation
    - Test: Small escaping variables use inline buffer
    - Test: Large escaping variables use arena
    - Benchmark: Measure allocation speedup

- [R] Label: T-opt-compiler-type-coverage
  Objective: Ensure type_id coverage for all 19 core types.
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.c (type definitions)
  Where: csrc/analysis/type_id.c (type mapping)
  What: Add type_name_to_type_id() mappings for any missing types.
  How:
    - Check which of the 19 types are missing from type_id.c
    - Add mappings for: array, string, symbol, dict, closure, box, channel, thread, error, atom, tuple, named_tuple, generic, kind, nothing
    - Ensure all types have correct can_inline and inline_threshold values

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Audit current coverage:**
        - Currently: int, float, char, pair (4 types)
        - Missing: 15 types
        - See type_id.c:22-124 for current mappings

    *   **Add missing type mappings:**
        ```c
        if (strcmp(type_name, "Array") == 0) return TYPE_ID_ARRAY;
        if (strcmp(type_name, "String") == 0) return TYPE_ID_STRING;
        if (strcmp(type_name, "Symbol") == 0) return TYPE_ID_SYMBOL;
        // ... add 12 more types
        ```

    *   **Add constructor patterns:**
        - Search codegen for array/string/symbol constructors
        - Map each to appropriate TYPE_ID constant

  Verification:
    - Test: All 19 types have type_name_to_type_id() mapping
    - Test: Type inference works for all types
    - Test: Codegen generates correct type_id for all types

- [R] Label: T-opt-compiler-benchmark-typed-codegen
  Objective: Benchmark the direct typed allocation codegen.
  Reference: runtime/bench/BENCHMARK_RESULTS_METADATA.md
  Where: Create csrc/bench/bench_typed_codegen.c
  What: Measure performance of alloc_obj_typed() codegen vs constructor codegen.
  How:
    - Create test programs that allocate various types
    - Compare old codegen (constructors) vs new codegen (typed alloc)
    - Measure: allocation speed, code size, compilation time

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Create benchmark suite:**
        ```c
        // Test 1: Integer allocation
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            Obj* x = mk_int(i);  // Old way
        }

        // Test 2: Integer allocation (typed)
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            Obj* x = alloc_obj_typed(region, TYPE_ID_INT);  // New way
            x->tag = TAG_INT;
            x->int_val = i;
        }
        ```

    *   **Test all core types:**
        - Integers, floats, pairs, arrays, strings
        - Measure: time per operation, total time, memory usage

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Compare old vs new codegen performance
    - Benchmark: Measure inline buffer hit rate
    - Document: Create BENCHMARK_RESULTS_TYPED_CODEGEN.md
    - Target: Same or better performance than constructors

### Previous Optimizations (Completed)- [DONE] Label: T-opt-bitmap-cycle-detection

  Objective: Replace uthash with bitmap-based cycle detection in transmigrate.c.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED 2.7-12.5x speedup!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - Small list (1K): 131.19 ns/op → 48.46 ns/op (**2.7x faster**)
  - Medium list (100K): 353.10 ns/op → 74.88 ns/op (**4.7x faster**)
  - Tree (15 nodes): 512,573 ns/op → 51,114 ns/op (**10.0x faster**)
  - Wide structure (100): 8,529,571 ns/op → 681,771 ns/op (**12.5x faster**)

  Implementation: Replaced uthash hash table with bitmap-based cycle detection using Arena allocation.
  - Eliminated malloc() overhead for hash table nodes
  - O(1) bitmap operations instead of hash table lookups
  - Single arena_free() cleanup instead of hash iteration
  - See runtime/src/memory/transmigrate.c lines 15-87 for bitmap implementation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-splicing

  Objective: Implement O(1) region splicing for functional programming patterns.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED O(1) performance!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - Small result (1K): 55.27 ns/op (bitmap) → 38.91 ns/op (splicing) = **1.4x faster**
  - Large result (100K): 83.22 ns/op (bitmap) → 42.81 ns/op (splicing) = **1.9x faster**
  - **Critical insight:** Splicing shows O(1) performance - time per operation is constant regardless of size!

  Implementation: Added fast path in transmigrate() for result-only regions:
  - Detects when source has external_rc==0 and scope_alive==false (region is closing)
  - Transfers entire arena chunk with pointer manipulation (O(1))
  - No object-by-object copying needed
  - See runtime/src/memory/transmigrate.c lines 171-194 for splicing implementation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-region-pool

  Objective: Pool/reuse regions to reduce creation overhead.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED 6.9-21.1x speedup!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - Small regions (1000): 1,050.95 ns/op → 49.80 ns/op (**21.1x faster!**)
  - Mixed lifetimes (100): 10.90 ns/op (fastest case with optimal reuse)
  - **Critical insight:** Pooling eliminates malloc/free overhead for region lifecycle

  Implementation: Added thread-local region pool with 32-slot capacity:
  - Fast path in region_create(): reuse from pool (no malloc)
  - Fast path in region_destroy_if_dead(): return to pool (no free)
  - Automatic reset when returning to pool (arena_free + control block reset)
  - Pool size limit prevents unbounded memory growth
  - See runtime/src/memory/region_core.c lines 6-33, 35-42, 82-88 for pool implementation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-inline-allocation

  Objective: Inline allocate small objects (< 64 bytes) in region.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED 6.99x speedup over raw malloc!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - Small objects (1K): 2.12 ns/op (472M ops/sec)
  - Inline vs malloc: 0.023s vs 0.160s = **6.99x faster!**
  - Mixed sizes: 2.92 ns/op (343M ops/sec)
  - Buffer exhaustion: 3.01 ns/op (333M ops/sec)
  - Closure allocation: 2.88 ns/op (348M ops/sec)

  Implementation: Added 512-byte inline buffer to Region struct for fast small object allocation:
  - Fast path in region_alloc(): bump-pointer allocation for objects <= 64 bytes
  - Eliminates malloc() overhead for small objects
  - Falls back to arena_alloc for larger objects or exhausted inline buffer
  - Zero overhead: inline buffer reset is part of existing region_reset()
  - See runtime/src/memory/region_core.h lines 9-18, runtime/src/memory/region_core.c lines 179-197 for implementation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-specialized-constructors

  Objective: Add specialized constructors for hot patterns (Lists, Trees).

  Verification: **ACHIEVED 5.55-6.32x speedup!** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - List construction (1000): 6.32x speedup, 1.02 ns/op (982M ops/sec)
  - Tree construction (8191 nodes): 5.55x speedup, 8191x fewer allocations
  - Medium list (100K): 1.89 ns/op (529M ops/sec)
  - Allocation reduction: 1000x-2000x fewer allocations

  Implementation: Added batch allocation constructors that allocate entire data structures in a single call:
  - mk_list_region(): Build list of n integers in one allocation (O(1) instead of O(n))
  - mk_tree_region(): Build complete binary tree in one allocation (O(1) instead of O(2^depth))
  - mk_list_from_array_region(): Build list from array in one allocation
  - Improved cache locality through contiguous memory allocation

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-transmigrate-batch
  Objective: Implement batched transmigration for object groups.
  Where: runtime/src/memory/transmigrate.c
  What: Transmigrate multiple objects in single operation.
  How: Queue objects and migrate in batches.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED parity with standard transmigration.** Benchmark results (2026-01-08):
  - List (100K): Chunk=500 provides 1.06x speedup over standard
  - Tree (65K nodes): Chunk=1000 achieves 0.95x (essentially same)
  - Large graph (262K nodes): 52.49 ns/op
  - Optimal chunk size: 500 objects

  Analysis: Batched transmigration provides equivalent performance for full graph access
  (0.89x-1.06x), with benefits for sparse access patterns and memory-constrained environments.
  Standard transmigration is already optimal due to bitmap cycle detection.

  Implementation: Added transmigrate_incremental() function that processes graphs in chunks:
  - Configurable chunk size parameter (0 = standard, 1-10000 = batched)
  - Progress tracking via float output parameter (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Same algorithm as transmigrate() with chunked worklist processing
  - O(1) splice fast path preserved for result-only regions

  - Standard mk_array_region: 3 allocations (Obj + Array + data)
  - Batch mk_array_region_batch: 2 allocations (Obj + combined Array+data)
  - Pre-filled arrays: Single allocation for data + integers

  Implementation: Added batch allocation constructors for arrays and dicts:

  - mk_array_of_ints_region(): Pre-filled integer arrays with inline values
  - mk_dict_region_batch(): Single allocation for Dict struct + bucket array
  - Improved cache locality through contiguous memory layout

  What: Mark region_alloc as static inline.
  How: Move hot path to header for inlining.

  Verification: **ACHIEVED call overhead elimination.**
  - region_alloc() now marked static inline in header
  - Inline buffer fast path (small objects) is fully inlineable
  - Eliminates function call overhead for hot allocation path
  - Compiler can optimize small object allocations to single instructions

  Implementation: Moved region_alloc implementation to header with static inline:

  - Slow path: Fallback to arena_alloc (still function call)
  - Zero abstraction penalty for common small object allocations
  - See runtime/src/memory/region_core.h lines 49-75

- [DONE] Label: T-opt-inline-hash-fastpath

  - hashmap_get() now marked static inline with inline hash computation
  - hashmap_contains() inlined (delegates to hashmap_get)
  - Hash computation and bucket lookup are now inlineable
  - Eliminates function call overhead for O(1) lookups

  Implementation: Moved critical hashmap operations to header with static inline:
  - FNV-1a style hash function inlined (pointer key → bucket index)
  - Linear search in bucket inlined
  - hashmap_get() and hashmap_contains() now inlineable
  - Reduces overhead for frequent hashmap operations
  - See runtime/src/util/hashmap.h lines 33-73

### Region-Level Metadata Optimization (Replaces Fat Pointers)

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-type-struct
  Objective: Define TypeMetadata structure and core data types for region-level metadata.
  Reference: Performance research showing region-level metadata eliminates per-object tag overhead while enabling inline allocation. Alternative to fat pointers with simpler implementation.
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.h (new file), runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.c (new file)
  Why:
    Current implementation stores tag field (8 bytes) in every object. Region-level metadata stores this information once per region, reducing memory overhead and enabling compile-time type resolution. This replaces the abandoned fat pointer approach with a simpler design that:
    - Eliminates per-object tag field (saves 4-8 bytes per object)
    - Enables inline allocation for small objects without fat pointers
    - Uses compile-time type_id constants (aligned with ASAP philosophy)
    - Integrates cleanly with existing RC-G memory model

  What to change:
    1. **Create TypeMetadata structure:**
       ```c
       typedef struct {
           const char* name;               // "Int", "Pair", "Array", ...
           size_t size;                    // Object size
           size_t alignment;               // Alignment requirement
           uint8_t num_pointer_fields;     // For GC/RC tracing
           uint8_t pointer_offsets[8];     // Offsets of pointer fields
           bool can_inline;                // Can this type be inlined?
           size_t inline_threshold;        // Max size for inlining
           void (*trace)(Obj* obj, void (*visit)(Obj**));
           void (*destroy)(Obj* obj);
           bool (*equals)(Obj* a, Obj* b);
           size_t (*hash)(Obj* obj);
       } TypeMetadata;
       ```

    2. **Modify Region structure:**
       ```c
       struct Region {
           Arena arena;
           InlineBuffer inline_buf;
           TypeMetadata* type_table;        // NEW: Centralized metadata
           uint32_t num_types;              // NEW: Number of types
           int external_rc;
           int tether_count;
           bool scope_alive;
       };
       ```

    3. **Modify Obj structure:**
       ```c
       struct Obj {
           uint32_t type_id;    // Index into region->type_table (replaces tag field)
           char data[];         // Flexible storage
       };
       ```

  Verification:
    - Compile runtime with new structures
    - TypeMetadata initialization succeeds for core types
    - Region structure initializes with type_table pointer
    - No regressions in existing tests

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-region-metadata-init
  Objective: Create metadata initialization for core types (Int, Pair, Array, etc.).
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.h
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.c
  Why: Bootstrap the type metadata system with definitions for all core OmniLisp types.
  What: Implement init_core_type_metadata() function that populates type_table.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **File: runtime/src/memory/region_metadata.c**
        ```c
        void init_core_type_metadata(Region* r) {
            // TYPE_ID_INT = 0
            r->type_table[0] = (TypeMetadata){
                .name = "Int",
                .size = sizeof(long),

### Thread-Local RC Optimization

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-thread-local-rc-detect
  Objective: Implement thread-local region detection.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 2: Thread-Local RC Optimization)
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_core.c, runtime/src/memory/region_core.h
  Why:
    Atomic RC operations are expensive (~50-100x slower than non-atomic). Most regions in functional programming are only accessed by a single thread. We can automatically detect this and use fast non-atomic operations.

  What to change:
    1. **Add thread-local detection:**
       ```c
       typedef struct Region {
           Arena arena;
           InlineBuffer inline_buf;
           TypeMetadata* type_table;
           uint32_t num_types;

           // NEW: Thread tracking
           pthread_t owner_thread;       // Thread that created this region
           bool is_thread_local;         // Cached detection result
           bool has_external_refs;       // Track if any external refs exist

           int external_rc;
           int tether_count;
           bool scope_alive;
       } Region;
       ```

    2. **Implement detection logic:**
       ```c
       bool region_is_thread_local(Region* r) {
           // Fast path: use cached result
           if (r->is_thread_local && !r->has_external_refs) {
               return true;
           }

           // Check if current thread is the owner
           if (pthread_equal(pthread_self(), r->owner_thread)) {
               // Check for external references (from other threads)
               // This would require tracking tether origins
               return !r->has_external_refs;
           }

           return false;
       }
       ```

    3. **Update RC operations:**
       ```c
       void region_retain_internal(Region* r) {
           if (region_is_thread_local(r)) {
               // NON-ATOMIC (10-50x faster)
               r->external_rc++;
           } else {
               // ATOMIC (current behavior)
               __atomic_add_fetch(&r->external_rc, 1, __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST);
           }
       }

       void region_release_internal(Region* r) {
           if (region_is_thread_local(r)) {
               r->external_rc--;
           } else {
               __atomic_sub_fetch(&r->external_rc, 1, __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST);
           }
       }
       ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: RC operations in single-threaded code (target: 5-10x speedup)
    - Unit test: Multi-threaded access still uses atomic operations
    - Stress test: No data races in concurrent scenarios
    - Measure: Before/after RC operation latency

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-thread-local-rc-tether
  Objective: Track tether origins to detect cross-thread access.
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/tethering.c (existing tether infrastructure)
  Where: runtime/src/memory/tethering.c, runtime/src/memory/region_core.c
  Why: Thread-local detection needs to know when tethers come from other threads.
  What: Add thread tracking to tether operations.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Modify tether tracking:**
        ```c
        struct TetherToken {
            Region* region;
            pthread_t tether_thread;  // NEW: Track which thread created tether
            // ... existing fields
        };

        void region_tether_start(Region* r) {
            // Mark region as having external refs if tether from different thread
            if (!pthread_equal(pthread_self(), r->owner_thread)) {
                r->has_external_refs = true;
            }
            // ... existing tether logic
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Unit test: Cross-thread tether sets has_external_refs flag
    - Unit test: Same-thread tether doesn't set flag
    - Benchmark: Thread-local regions with no external refs use non-atomic RC

### Lobster-Style Ownership Analysis

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-ownership-types
  Objective: Extend VarUsage tracking with ownership types.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 3: Lobster-Style Ownership Analysis)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.h, csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why:
    Lobster achieves 50-95% RC reduction through compile-time ownership analysis. By tracking whether a variable is borrowed, owned, or consumed, we can eliminate redundant RC operations.

  What to change:
    1. **Add ownership tracking to VarUsage:**
       ```c
       typedef enum {
           OWNERSHIP_BORROWED,   // Reference, don't inc/dec
           OWNERSHIP_OWNED,      // Owner, must dec when done
           OWNERSHIP_CONSUMED,   // Will be consumed (moved), no dec needed
           OWNERSHIP_UNKNOWN     // Conservative: assume owned
       } OwnershipKind;

       typedef struct VarUsage {
           const char* name;
           bool is_used;
           bool is_last_use;        // Existing
           EscapeStatus escape;     // Existing

           // NEW: Ownership tracking
           OwnershipKind ownership;
           bool is_consumed;        // Will this be moved/consumed?
       } VarUsage;
       ```

    2. **Ownership analysis rules:**
       ```c
       // In analyze_expr() - track ownership
       void analyze_ownership(ASTNode* node, Context* ctx) {
           switch (node->type) {
               case AST_VAR_REF:
                   // Look up ownership from context
                   OwnershipKind owner = get_ownership(ctx, node->var_name);

                   // If this is the last use, mark as consumed
                   if (is_last_use(ctx, node->var_name)) {
                       set_ownership(ctx, node->var_name, OWNERSHIP_CONSUMED);
                   }
                   break;

               case AST_LAMBDA:
                   // Captured variables are borrowed (owned by closure)
                   for each captured_var {
                       set_ownership(ctx, var, OWNERSHIP_BORROWED);
                   }
                   break;

               case AST_LET:
                   // Newly bound variables are owned
                   set_ownership(ctx, node->var_name, OWNERSHIP_OWNED);
                   break;
           }
       }
       ```

  Verification:
    - Unit test: Variable ownership tracked correctly
    - Unit test: Last use marked as consumed
    - Unit test: Captured variables marked as borrowed
    - Integration test: Analysis completes without errors

            // Generate load
            emit_load(node->var_name);

            // Only inc_ref if needed
            if (info.ownership == OWNERSHIP_BORROWED) {
                // Borrowed: no inc_ref needed
                // (already accounted for by owner)
            } else if (info.ownership == OWNERSHIP_CONSUMED) {
                // Consumed: no inc_ref, will be moved
            } else if (info.is_last_use) {

                emit_dec_ref();
                emit_free_if_zero();
            }
        }
        ```

    *   **Example transformation:**
        ```lisp
        ;; Original OmniLisp:
        (define sum [xs]
          (match xs
            [] 0
            [h & t] (+ h (sum t))))

        ;; Compiler analysis:
        ;; - h is OWNERSHIP_OWNED (bound in pattern)
        ;; - h is CONSUMED in expression (+ h ...)
        ;; - No inc_ref needed for h
        ;; - No dec_ref needed for h (consumed)

        ;; Generated code (optimized):
        // NO inc_ref for h
        sum = load(h);  // Just load, no RC
        result = add(sum, sum_t);
        // NO dec_ref for h (consumed)
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: RC operation count (target: 50-95% reduction)
    - Integration test: Functional programs run correctly
    - Memory test: No memory leaks (owned values still freed)
    - Regression test: All existing tests pass

### Perceus-Style Optimized RC

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-perceus-update-elimination
  Objective: Implement update elimination (inc/dec cancellation).
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 4: Perceus-Style Optimized RC)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (add new pass)
  Why: Perceus eliminates redundant RC operations through compile-time analysis.
  What: Detect and eliminate inc_ref/dec_ref pairs.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Update elimination pass:**
        ```c
        // New analysis pass after ownership analysis
        typedef struct RCOp {
            enum { OP_INC, OP_DEC } op;
            ASTNode* var;
            int id;  // Unique ID for this operation
        } RCOp;

        // Track RC operations in basic block
        List* rc_ops = collect_rc_operations(function);

        // Find cancellable pairs
        for (int i = 0; i < list_length(rc_ops); i++) {
            RCOp* op1 = list_get(rc_ops, i);

            // Look for matching dec after inc
            if (op1->op == OP_INC) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < list_length(rc_ops); j++) {
                    RCOp* op2 = list_get(rc_ops, j);

                    if (op2->op == OP_DEC &&
                        strcmp(op1->var->name, op2->var->name) == 0 &&
                        ! intervening_use(op1->var, op1->id, op2->id)) {
                        // Found cancellable pair!
                        mark_for_elimination(op1);
                        mark_for_elimination(op2);
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```

    *   **Example:**
        ```lisp
        ;; Programmer writes (might generate redundant RC):
        (let [x (some-exp)]
          (inc-ref x)    ;; Op 1
          (do-something x)
          (dec-ref x))   ;; Op 2 - cancels with Op 1

        ;; Compiler eliminates both:
        (let [x (some-exp)]
          (do-something x))
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: RC operation count reduction
    - Unit test: Inc/dec pairs eliminated
    - Unit test: No intervening uses → elimination
    - Unit test: Intervening uses → no elimination

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-perceus-reuse-analysis
  Objective: Implement reuse analysis for "consumed" values.
  Reference: https://koka-lang.org/perceus/ (Perceus documentation)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c
  Why: Detect when values are "dead" after last use and eliminate RC operations.
  What: Extend ownership analysis with reuse detection.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Reuse analysis:**
        ```c
        // After ownership analysis, find values that can be "reused"
        void analyze_reuse(ASTNode* node) {
            switch (node->type) {
               case AST_MATCH:
                   // Pattern bindings consume values
                   for each pattern_var {
                       if (is_unique_use(pattern_var, node->scope)) {
                           // This value is uniquely consumed
                           mark_as_reuse(pattern_var);
                       }
                   }
                   break;

               case AST_FUNCTION_CALL:
                   // Arguments that are consumed
                   for each arg {
                       if (function_consumes_arg(function, arg)) {
                           mark_as_reuse(arg);
                       }
                   }
                   break;
           }
        }
        ```

    *   **Integration with codegen:**
        ```c
        void codegen_reused_var(ASTNode* var) {
            // Reused variables: no RC operations
            emit_load(var->name);
            // No inc_ref (will be consumed)
            // No dec_ref (consumed by callee)
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Functional code with pattern matching (target: 30-50% fewer RC ops)
    - Unit test: Pattern-bound variables marked as reused
    - Integration test: Functional programs speed up

### Immutable Region Views

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-immutable-view-api
  Objective: Add immutable view API to Region.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 5: Immutable Region Views)
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_core.c, runtime/src/memory/region_core.h
  Why:
    Generation checks on every access are expensive. For read-only phases, we can skip these checks entirely by marking regions as temporarily immutable.

  What to change:
    1. **Add immutable view API:**
       ```c
       typedef struct Region {
           Arena arena;
           InlineBuffer inline_buf;
           TypeMetadata* type_table;
           uint32_t num_types;

           // NEW: Immutable view tracking
           int immutable_view_depth;     // Nesting depth of immutable views
           uint64_t immutable_generation; // Generation when view started

           int external_rc;
           int tether_count;
           bool scope_alive;
       } Region;
       ```

    2. **Implement view functions:**
        ```c
        void region_begin_immutable_view(Region* r) {
            if (r->immutable_view_depth == 0) {
                // First view: capture current generation
                r->immutable_generation = r->generation;
            }
            r->immutable_view_depth++;
        }

        void region_end_immutable_view(Region* r) {
            r->immutable_view_depth--;
            // No action needed: generation checks just use immutable_view_depth
        }

        // In generation check fast path:
        bool region_check_generation(Region* r, Obj* obj, uint64_t gen) {
            if (r->immutable_view_depth > 0) {
                // Skip check during immutable view
                return true;
            }
            // Normal generation check
            return obj->generation == r->generation;
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Read-heavy traversals (target: 2-3x speedup)
    - Unit test: Nested views work correctly
    - Unit test: Generation checks skipped during view
    - Unit test: Generation checks resume after view ends

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-immutable-purity-analysis
  Objective: Implement purity analysis for automatic immutable view generation.
  Reference: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (existing escape infrastructure)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: Automatically detect pure functions and wrap them with immutable views.
  What: Analyze function purity and generate view markers.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Purity analysis:**
        ```c
       typedef enum {
           FUNCTION_PURE,          // No side effects, no mutations
           FUNCTION_READS_INPUTS,  // Only reads inputs
           FUNCTION_MUTATES,       // Has side effects
           FUNCTION_UNKNOWN        // Conservative: assume mutates
       } FunctionPurity;

       FunctionPurity analyze_function_purity(ASTNode* func) {
           // Check if function:
           // 1. Doesn't modify global state
           // 2. Doesn't call mutating functions
           // 3. Doesn't perform I/O
           // 4. Only reads its inputs

           if (has_side_effects(func)) {
               return FUNCTION_MUTATES;
           } else if (only_reads_inputs(func)) {
               return FUNCTION_READS_INPUTS;
           } else {
               return FUNCTION_PURE;
           }
       }
       ```

    *   **Codegen integration:**
        ```c
       void codegen_function_call(ASTNode* call) {
           FunctionPurity purity = get_function_purity(call->func);

           if (purity == FUNCTION_PURE || purity == FUNCTION_READS_INPUTS) {
               // Wrap call in immutable view
               emit("region_begin_immutable_view(r);");
               codegen_call_args(call);
               emit("region_end_immutable_view(r);");
           } else {
               // Normal call
               codegen_call_args(call);
           }
       }
       ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Pure function traversals (target: 2-3x speedup)
    - Unit test: Pure functions detected correctly
    - Unit test: Impure functions not wrapped
    - Integration test: Tree traversals speed up

### Hybrid-Generational Memory

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-hybrid-escape-tracking
  Objective: Extend escape analysis to track region-local objects.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 6: Hybrid-Generational Memory)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (extend existing escape analysis)
  Why:
    Objects that never escape their region can use arena allocation (no generation checks). This is a major optimization for functional programming patterns.

  What to change:
    1. **Add region escape tracking:**
       ```c
       typedef enum {
           ESCAPE_REGION_NONE,      // Stays in region
           ESCAPE_REGION_RETURN,    // Returned from function
           ESCAPE_REGION_CROSS,     // Crosses region boundary
           ESCAPE_REGION_GLOBAL,    // Escapes to global scope
       } RegionEscapeStatus;

       typedef struct VarUsage {
           // ... existing fields
           RegionEscapeStatus region_escape;
       } VarUsage;
       ```

    2. **Analyze region escape:**
        ```c
       void analyze_region_escape(ASTNode* node, Region* current_region) {
           switch (node->type) {
               case AST_ALLOC:
                   // New allocation: starts as region-local
                   set_region_escape(node, ESCAPE_REGION_NONE, current_region);
                   break;

               case AST_RETURN:
                   // Returned value escapes region
                   mark_region_escape(node->value, ESCAPE_REGION_RETURN);
                   break;

               case AST_STORE:
                   // Storing to global: escapes region
                   if (is_global_location(node->target)) {
                       mark_region_escape(node->value, ESCAPE_REGION_GLOBAL);
                   }
                   break;

               case AST_ASSIGN:
                   // Cross-region assignment
                   if (target_region != source_region) {
                       mark_region_escape(node->value, ESCAPE_REGION_CROSS);
                   }
                   break;
           }
       }
       ```

  Verification:
    - Unit test: Region-local allocations detected
    - Unit test: Cross-region assignments tracked
    - Unit test: Returns detected as escaping
    - Integration test: Analysis completes for real programs

- [TODO] Label: T-opt-hybrid-allocation-selection
  Objective: Implement automatic arena vs generational allocation selection.
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/region_core.c (region_alloc)
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_core.c, csrc/codegen/codegen.c
  Why: Use fast arena allocation for region-local objects, generational for escaping objects.
  What: Select allocation strategy based on region escape analysis.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Codegen for hybrid allocation:**
        ```c
        void codegen_alloc(ASTNode* alloc) {
           RegionEscapeStatus escape = get_region_escape(alloc);

           if (escape == ESCAPE_REGION_NONE) {
               // Region-local: use arena (no generation)
               emit("arena_alloc(r->arena, size)");
           } else {
               // Escaping: use generational (with generation)
               emit("region_alloc(r, size)");  // Has generation checks
           }
        }
        ```

    *   **Runtime support:**
        ```c
        void* region_alloc_local(Region* r, size_t size) {
           // Arena allocation: no generation needed
           return arena_alloc(&r->arena, size);
        }

        void* region_alloc_escaping(Region* r, size_t size) {
           // Normal allocation: with generation tracking
           Obj* obj = arena_alloc(&r->arena, size + sizeof(uint64_t));
           obj->generation = r->generation;
           return obj;
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Region-local allocations (target: 50-80% fewer generation checks)
    - Unit test: Region-local objects use arena
    - Unit test: Escaping objects use generational
    - Memory test: No memory leaks

### Automatic Arena Mode for Pure Functions

  Objective: Implement purity analysis for automatic arena allocation.
  Reference: docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md (Priority 7: Automatic Arena Mode)
  Where: csrc/analysis/analysis.c (extend purity analysis)
  Why: Functions that don't return references can use arena allocation with automatic cleanup.
  What: Detect functions that can use automatic arena mode.

  Implementation Details:
    *   **Arena eligibility analysis:**
        ```c
       bool can_use_auto_arena(ASTNode* func) {
           // Function is eligible if:
           // 1. Doesn't return pointers to locals
           // 2. No mutable closures capturing locals
           // 3. No references escape the function

           if (returns_local_references(func)) {
               return false;  // Can't use auto arena
           }

           if (has_captured_mutable_closures(func)) {
               return false;  // Can't use auto arena
           }

           if (has_global_side_effects(func)) {
               return false;  // Can't use auto arena
           }

           return true;  // Safe for auto arena
       }
       ```

    *   **Example:**
        ```lisp
        ;; Programmer writes:
        (define process [data]
          (let [temp1 (compute data)]
              [temp2 (transform temp1)]
            (result temp2)))

        ;; Compiler analyzes:
        ;; - temp1 never escapes function
        ;; - temp2 never escapes function
        ;; - Only return value escapes
        ;; - Eligible for auto arena!

        ;; Generated code:

           region_exit(r);  // Auto cleanup
           return result;
        }
        ```

  Verification:
    - Benchmark: Short-lived workloads (target: 2-5x speedup)
    - Unit test: Pure functions detected correctly
    - Unit test: Impure functions not auto-arena'd

           if (can_use_auto_arena(func)) {
               // Add arena prologue

## Phase 22: Feature Wiring - Codegen Stubs & Missing Primitives [ACTIVE]

**Objective:** Wire all stubbed and unimplemented features identified in the codebase to achieve full language functionality.

### Category A: String Literals & Print Output (BLOCKING END-TO-END TESTING)

- [TODO] Label: T-wire-string-literal-01
  Objective: Fix string literal generation in codegen.
  Reference: csrc/codegen/codegen.c:891-894
  Where: csrc/codegen/codegen.c (codegen_string function)
  Why: Strings currently emit as symbols (mk_sym), causing type confusion
  What: Replace mk_sym() with proper string constructor
  Implementation Details:
    - Change `omni_codegen_emit_raw(ctx, "mk_sym(\"%s\")", expr->str_val);`
    - To: `omni_codegen_emit_raw(ctx, "mk_string_region(_local_region, \"%s\", %d)", expr->str_val, strlen(expr->str_val));`
    - Or use mk_string() if not region-based
  Verification: (println "hello") should print as string, not symbol

- [TODO] Label: T-wire-string-literal-02
  Objective: Implement TAG_STRING support in region_value.c.
  Reference: runtime/src/memory/region_value.c:94-96
  Where: runtime/src/memory/region_value.c
  Why: mk_string_region currently returns mk_sym_region (TODO comment)
  What: Create proper TAG_STRING values
  Implementation Details:
    - Add TAG_STRING case to region_value allocation
    - Implement mk_string_region to allocate proper string objects
    - Strings should have: tag=TAG_STRING, length, char* data
  Verification: (type? "hello" String) should return true

- [TODO] Label: T-wire-string-literal-03
  Objective: Add string comparison and equality.
  Where: runtime/src/runtime.c or runtime/src/string_utils.c
  Why: Strings need proper equality semantics
  What: Implement prim_string_eq, prim_string_compare
  Implementation Details:
