# OmniLisp Architecture

OmniLisp uses a high-performance, GC-less execution model based on **As Static As Possible (ASAP)** memory management and **Region-Based Reference Counting (RC-G)**.

---

## 1. Unified Pipeline

The OmniLisp system is composed of two primary components:

1.  **Compiler (`csrc/`)**: A standalone compiler written in C99.
    *   **Parser**: Pika Parser (Packrat PEG).
    *   **Analysis**: Escape analysis, Region Inference, Scope Tree generation.
    *   **Codegen**: Generates C99 code annotated with Region lifecycle calls.
2.  **Runtime (`runtime/`)**: A static library (`libomni.a`) providing the execution environment.
    *   **Memory**: Regions, Arenas, Tethers, Transmigration.
    *   **Primitives**: Core language functions (arithmetic, I/O, list ops).
    *   **Concurrency**: Thread spawning, channels, atomic operations.

### Key Stages:
1.  **Pika Parser**: A bottom-up dynamic programming parser that handles left recursion natively.
2.  **Region Inference**: A static analysis pass that identifies object lifetimes and groups them into Regions.
3.  **ASAP Analysis**: Determines the "Last Use Point" for every Region and individual object, injecting static `region_create` / `region_exit` calls.
4.  **Codegen**: Translates the annotated AST into optimized C code linked against `libomni.a`.

## 2. Runtime Model (RC-G)

The runtime provides the physical foundation for the ASAP model.

- **Regions**: Logical owners of memory blocks (`Region` struct).
- **Arenas**: Physical storage backend (bump-pointer allocation).
- **Tethers**: Thread-local mechanisms for safe concurrent access without global locks.
- **Transmigration**: Efficient movement of data between regions using iterative deep copy or block splicing.

## 3. Concurrency Model

OmniLisp supports:
1.  **Threads**: OS-level parallelism using POSIX pthreads, synchronized via Region Tethers and Channels.
2.  **Channels**: Typed conduits for moving objects (and their ownership) between threads/regions.

---

## 4. Portability & Compliance

- **Core**: ANSI C99.
- **Synchronization**: POSIX pthreads / C11 Atomics.
- **Memory**: strictly **manual/static** (no runtime GC loop).
