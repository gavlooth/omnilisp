# Session 34-44 Boundary Hardening Playbook

Scope:
- Consolidate lifetime/ownership transitions into one audited boundary API.
- Improve old internals (code quality + business logic), not just wrap them.
- Keep behavior stable while reducing bug surface.

Execution policy:
- Do not advance sessions unless all gates pass.
- Keep commits small and domain-local.
- Prefer behavior-preserving refactors before semantic changes.

## Current Status (2026-03-04)

- Sessions 34-44 goals: completed in sequence (see `memory/CHANGELOG.md` and commit history).
- Continued hardening/decomposition after Session 44: Sessions 45-68 completed.
- Validation discipline held for each session:
  - `c3c build`
  - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main`
  - `c3c build --sanitize=address`
  - `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0,halt_on_error=1,abort_on_error=1 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main`

### Post-44 Continuation Snapshot (Sessions 45-68)

- Boundary API expansion and caller migration completed across eval/jit/env/value/module paths.
- Scoped allocation/switch helpers consolidated (`enter/leave`, `push/pop child scope`, scoped env helpers).
- JIT/runtime lifetime hardening completed for:
  - closure env-copy paths
  - root promotion paths
  - scoped eval/finalization paths
  - constructor allocation failure paths
- Hotspot decomposition continued in scheduler/runtime modules:
  - scheduler await/cancel/join/spawn/offload paths
  - wakeup drain event handlers
  - JIT set-path and cache warm traversal helpers
