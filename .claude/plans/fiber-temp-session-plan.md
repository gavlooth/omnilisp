# Fiber Temp Session Plan (Execution Cadence)

Date: 2026-03-05  
Source roadmap: `.claude/plans/fiber-temp-detailed-implementation-plan.md`  
Target cadence: 16 sessions (small, auditable commits)

## Current Checkpoint (2026-03-05)

Completed this session:
- `1)` Design freeze sign-off: **pass** (proposal/guardrail docs aligned and frozen for execution).
- `2)` Ownership/guardrail checkpoint: **conditional pass**.
  - Region-centric ownership and no per-type RC drift remain enforced.
  - Open exception to resolve in next session (`4`): `src/stack_engine.c3` still has legacy direct scope touchpoints (`stack_ctx_pin_scope`, `stack_ctx_unpin_scope`, `pinned_scope` field).
- `3)` Defer hot-path perf sign-off: **pass** with runtime counters and zero heap-overflow allocations in current suite run.
  - `STACK_DEFER_METRICS push=8 undefer=1 destroy_cb=9 clone_cb=1 update_arg=2 cloned_entries=2 peak_depth=3 heap_alloc=0`
- `4)` Deferred by request to next session.

Validation evidence:
- Normal: `c3c build` + `OMNI_TEST_QUIET=1 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main`  
  Result: `Stack engine 14/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- ASAN strict: `c3c clean` + `c3c build --sanitize=address` + `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1:halt_on_error=1:abort_on_error=1 OMNI_TEST_QUIET=1 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main`  
  Result: `Stack engine 14/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.

## Item 4 Follow-up (2026-03-05)

Completed in subsequent session:
- Removed legacy stack-layer direct scope touchpoints from `src/stack_engine.c3`:
  - `pinned_scope` field removed
  - `stack_ctx_pin_scope(...)` removed
  - `stack_ctx_unpin_scope(...)` removed
- Migrated suspend sites to defer-backed boundary guard usage (`suspend_with_scope_guard(...)`) in:
  - `src/lisp/jit_jit_runtime_effects.c3`
  - `src/lisp/jit_jit_handle_signal.c3`
  - `src/lisp/jit_jit_reset_shift.c3`
  - `src/lisp/primitives_iter_coroutine.c3`

Validation for follow-up:
- `c3c build` + `OMNI_TEST_QUIET=1 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main`: pass (`Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1178/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)
- `c3c clean && c3c build --sanitize=address` + strict ASAN run: pass (`Stack engine 14/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`)

## Fiber TEMP Phase 1 Progress (2026-03-05)

Completed:
- Added conservative `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP` scaffold in `scope_region`:
  - chunk-pool state and helpers,
  - TEMP-lane reclaim hook in destroy/reset/splice paths,
  - summary counters (`OMNI_TEST_SUMMARY suite=fiber_temp_pool ...`).
- Validation remains green in normal + ASAN with flag OFF and ON smoke run.

Next:
- Start eligibility routing (narrow whitelist) so selected TEMP allocations can use Fiber TEMP in active stack contexts.

## Fiber TEMP Phase 2 Progress (2026-03-05)

Completed:
- Introduced narrow eligibility gate:
  - scopes become Fiber TEMP eligible only when created in active stack contexts (`OMNI_FIBER_TEMP` enabled, stack context active, parent scope present).
  - TEMP lane only: ESCAPE lane remains raw alloc/free.
- Added stack-engine exercise test for in-context scope create/release to drive pool metrics under the flag.

Validation:
- Normal: `Stack engine 16/0`, `Unified 1178/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- ASAN strict: `Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- Flagged metrics now non-zero (`hits=3`, `misses=3`, `returns=6`, `eligible_slow=4`, `bypass_large=0`), confirming active path exercise.

Next:
- Expand allocation-shape whitelist beyond size-only checks (for example bypass pool routing once ESCAPE-lane activity appears in a scope).

## Fiber TEMP Phase 2b Progress (2026-03-05)

Completed:
- Extended allocation-shape whitelist to include ESCAPE activity:
  - Fiber TEMP slow-path routing now requires no ESCAPE chunks/dtors on the scope.
  - Added `bypass_escape` metric counter for explicit observability.
- Extended stack-engine in-context scope test to exercise both:
  - a TEMP-heavy eligible scope,
  - a mixed TEMP+ESCAPE scope that should bypass Fiber TEMP pool routing.

Validation:
- Normal: `Stack engine 16/0`, `Unified 1178/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- ASAN strict: `Stack engine 15/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- Flagged metrics: `hits=1`, `misses=3`, `returns=6`, `eligible_slow=2`, `bypass_large=0`, `bypass_escape=2`.

Next:
- Add focused assertions around Fiber TEMP pool invariants (take/reclaim behavior and bypass counters) without coupling tests to suite order.

## Fiber TEMP Phase 2c Progress (2026-03-05)

Completed:
- Added focused Fiber TEMP pool invariant checks in `scope_region`:
  - reclaim path (return vs drop behavior),
  - take-hit path,
  - take-miss path,
  using local before/after deltas to avoid suite-order coupling.

Validation:
- Normal: `Stack engine 16/0`, `Scope region 51/0`, `Unified 1178/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- ASAN strict: `Stack engine 15/0`, `Scope region 51/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- Flagged metrics include exercised pool counters:
  - `hits=2`, `misses=4`, `returns=8`, `eligible_slow=2`, `bypass_escape=2`.

Next:
- Begin per-fiber TEMP ownership plumbing behind the flag while preserving stack-layer genericity (no direct scope logic in stack engine).

## Fiber TEMP Enablement Substrate Progress (2026-03-05)

Completed:
- Added a generic `StackCtx` lifecycle callback channel in `stack_engine` that is independent of LIFO defer push/pop.
- Added coverage for:
  - lifecycle destroy isolation from `stack_ctx_undefer(...)`,
  - lifecycle clone hook behavior.

Why this step:
- A previous attempt to bind persistent resource state via dynamic defer registration exposed a real risk:
  non-LIFO registrations can violate call-site assumptions around `stack_ctx_undefer(...)`.
- Lifecycle channel provides the correct primitive for persistent context-owned resources.

Validation:
- Normal: `Stack engine 18/0`, `Scope region 51/0`, `Unified 1178/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- ASAN strict: `Stack engine 17/0`, `Scope region 51/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.

Next:
- Re-attempt Fiber TEMP per-context ownership using lifecycle callbacks (not defer stack), keeping default behavior unchanged when flag is off.

## Fiber TEMP Phase 3 Progress (2026-03-05)

Completed:
- Wired per-`StackCtx` Fiber TEMP chunk caches through lifecycle hooks:
  - context-local take/reclaim path added,
  - clone-aware shared context state via lifecycle clone callback,
  - lifecycle destroy callback flushes residual chunks to global pool.
- Extended metrics and tests:
  - summary now includes `ctx_hits` and `ctx_returns`,
  - stack-context exercise test now asserts `ctx_returns` delta under the flag.

Validation:
- Normal: `Stack engine 18/0`, `Scope region 51/0`, `Unified 1178/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- ASAN strict: `Stack engine 17/0`, `Scope region 51/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- Flagged: `ctx_hits=1`, `ctx_returns=6`, no assertion failures.

Next:
- Stress clone/discard permutations with Fiber TEMP enabled to verify shared-context cache behavior under multi-shot continuation patterns.

## Fiber TEMP Phase 4 Progress (2026-03-05)

Completed:
- Added clone/discard stress coverage in stack-engine tests for Fiber TEMP lifecycle paths.
- New stress test validates repeated:
  - suspend,
  - clone + discard clone,
  - resume original to completion,
  with scope create/alloc/release around suspend boundaries.
- Under `OMNI_FIBER_TEMP=1`, test asserts per-context cache return activity (`ctx_return_count` delta).

Validation:
- Normal: `Stack engine 19/0`, `Scope region 51/0`, `Unified 1178/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- ASAN strict: `Stack engine 18/0`, `Scope region 51/0`, `Unified 1177/0`, `Compiler 73/0`.
- Flagged metrics show substantial ctx-path exercise (`ctx_hits=33`, `ctx_returns=70`).

Next:
- Add cross-thread/offload guard tests to ensure Fiber TEMP remains confined to stack-context owner thread and global fallback remains safe under worker interactions.

## Session Rules

Global rule for every session:

```bash
c3c build
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main
```

Memory/lifetime touching sessions additionally require:

```bash
c3c build --sanitize=address
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1:halt_on_error=1:abort_on_error=1 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/main
```

Commit discipline:
- One session can produce 1-3 commits.
- Keep commits phase-local and revertable.
- Update `memory/CHANGELOG.md` for behavior-impacting lifetime changes.

Hard stop conditions:
1. Stack engine needs direct `ScopeRegion` operations to proceed.
2. Any per-type RC lifetime appears for language graph values.
3. New ASAN UAF/double-free/leak appears after integration.
4. Clone/discard behavior becomes non-deterministic.

## Deliverable Checkpoints

Checkpoint A (after Session 6):
- Defer substrate integrated into boundary paths; no known teardown leak path unresolved.

Checkpoint B (after Session 9):
- Regressions locked; defer overhead acceptable.

Checkpoint C (after Session 13):
- Fiber-temp plumbing and eligibility routing functional behind feature flag.

Checkpoint D (after Session 16):
- Production rollout decision with evidence and rollback plan.

## Notes on Throughput

- If sessions are run in parallel branches, merge order must still follow dependency chain:
  - Sessions 1-6 serial required.
  - Sessions 7-9 can partially overlap.
  - Sessions 10-16 should be mostly serial due to shared core files.
- Prefer one active high-risk runtime session at a time to minimize conflict and hidden regressions.
