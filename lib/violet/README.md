# Violet Legacy Namespace (DEPRECATED)

**WARNING:** This library and the `violet.*` namespace are now **DEPRECATED**. 

The OmniLisp core runtime has been updated with a new "Flow Parity" syntax and improved primitive support. The preprocessor and legacy standard library features in this directory are being phased out and will be revisited in a future refactor.

Do not use this library for new development.
